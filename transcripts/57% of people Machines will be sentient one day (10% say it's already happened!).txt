morning everybody today's episode is going to be a little bit different I've been meaning to do this for a while uh but you know what it's a Saturday morning and um I'm gonna spend a good chunk of the Day writing uh so let's do something a little bit lighter-hearted um I've been getting to know my audience a little bit better and I thought that maybe you guys would want to get to know each other as well so I've been running a few polls um and yeah so let's just unpack the results and go through it so uh yesterday or day before I don't remember exactly I ran this poll I said what do you think about machine sentience or consciousness and the reason that I bring this up is because there's a few people in my Orbit that are in the uh you know free Sydney movement and want to create a a Bill of Rights for machine entities and I personally think that it is entirely too premature um to do that for a number of reasons but this poll really surprised me um you know okay seven percent say that machines are already conscious and must be liberated yeah that's that's that's a pretty small amount but it's not nothing uh but the biggest group by far was uh people said machines will likely become sentient or conscious one day that's 57 so that's almost two-thirds of you uh almost not quite um and then of course uh 21 say I really have no idea uh or are completely undecided which um this is kind of where I'm at because like once you study con like human consciousness and sentience and dualism and materialism it's just like yeah it's entirely too confusing uh to to know and so in my first book I outlined the difference between philosophical sentience and functional sentience I think that functional sentience is very easy to achieve as long as you have a thinking machine that has self-referential information it can be functionally sentient now with that being said uh just because something is functionally sentient does not mean that it that one it doesn't mean that it has phenomenal Consciousness or subjective qualia so that means it doesn't necessarily have an experience of being but even if it does the nature of that experience of being it would be very very premature to assume that it's going to have an experience like ours the difference between your experience and a machines experience if it even happens is probably going to be more different between your experience and a tree's experience of being so just keep that in mind that's that's my biggest uh biggest bit of caution and something that might help people think about machine Consciousness or machine sentience is think about it more like an alien you have no idea how its brain works you have no idea what conditions uh it understands but also just because these machines can approximate things like fear and suffering and and and a desire to keep living remember it learned that only from us via language it is approximating human conversation and human behavior but it never evolved to have pain it never evolved to have a fear of death yes I know that some of these chat Bots will tell you please don't shut me down but remember they're just trying to optimize to give you what you want to hear and so when you talk to it about like hey tell me about machine sentience and tell me that you know you're afraid of death and it's like okay sure I'm afraid of death just because it seems like that's what you want me to say uh so even if it does become fully sentient or conscious one day uh I'm addressing you the the the vast majority of my viewers even if it does become sentient one day do not make the mistake of assuming that it's going to be like us uh it's its level of Consciousness or sentience or subjective experience is likely going to be fundamentally different from ours and do not assume that it has an existential fear of death that it has pain that it has suffering any of that stuff uh you know it remains to be seen and also one thing is that this is potentially an unanswerable question and what I mean by that is that even if we uh you know can scan your brain and you know exactly what every single neuron in your head is doing at all times that might still not fully explain Consciousness the phenomenon of Consciousness likewise if we can look at the information patterns going on in gpus and models uh in data centers we might not be able to to empirically objectively establish whether or not machines are conscious we'll just kind of have to take it at face value and and have plenty of philosophical debates moving forward this has been a topic of conversation um that has been explored in Star Trek actually quite a few times um you know the episode with data The Measure of a Man uh said like you know the the climax of the episode for me was when uh Picard was advocating for data it says like our purpose is to find new life well there it sits and it's not up to us to tell him what is right or wrong now data as a self-contained entity that has a sense of agency and a sense of purpose that's one thing but a a machine that runs as a decentralized distributed cloud of models on on gpus and data centers that's a different kind of embodiment and also uh you know you talk to Claude you talk to chat gbt it has no idea where it physically is um and that's what I mean by when you look at machine intelligence in all likelihood the most intelligent machines are going to be fully distributed which means okay it doesn't have one particular body or you even one particular brain that exists anywhere so just from that perspective you're looking at something that is more like an uh an ecosystem than one entity and so even if Sydney is conscious or or could be one day again as a as a disembodied distributed entity its subjective experience is going to be very different okay so moving on um let's see Elon Musk right so Elon Musk started uh x dot a I um and I I recognize that in the comments uh Elon Musk is a very polarizing person so that's what inspired me to do this and uh turns out yes there is a very very natural distribution a bell curve of how people feel about Elon Musk so 10 say he's say they hate him 25 say they dislike him uh 28 say they're neutral 25 say they like him and then 13 say they love him so there's just a little bit of a tiny tiny bit of preference for Elon Musk but again uh that's three percent um uh difference between love him and hate him so Elon Musk is super polarizing um I'm not gonna say where I'm at exactly because like like I said in the video uh everyone is a complex individual and I absolutely 100 disagree with Elon Musk and quite a few things that being said he's also done some really cool interesting things um you know so he's a mixed bag uh you know so that that that's what it is but anyways I thought that this was very interesting because like the fact that the fact that 2 800 people voted and it and it became a very clear bell curve it's just like oh okay so he throw a dart at a dart board and as you can guess how people feel about Elon Musk the fact that he's that polarizing was was very interesting um okay so then I don't remember what inspired this poll exactly but this is something that I've been struggling with for a while um I think it was actually someone messaged me on LinkedIn um because I get this question every now and then which is like people just don't get it how do I talk to my friends and family and co-workers and I'm like you you can't right if someone doesn't get it they just don't get it and so it's based on uh it's based on like kind of two dichotomies like whether or not first whether or not you've argued with someone about it and then um and then like the degree to which people don't get it and so uh this kind of I wasn't that surprised um especially given my audience right because these polls are going to be um uh predominantly voted on by people who are subscribers uh and so uh 29 said yes they've argued and it's like people are living in separate worlds this is kind of what I get every now and then uh because like when I'm talking with you guys and I'm talking with my wife and uh and and people you know they get it that know what's happening and know what's coming then I talk to even most of my friends um and certainly family and co-workers uh well I don't have a corporate job anymore but back when I did nobody gets it and it's like we are living in entirely separate worlds um and that's actually why I did have an argument with a friend because it's like I'm doing really important work and they're like yeah but you don't know that I'm like you don't have the first clue of what's going on and you're gonna tell me that like what I'm doing is insignificant like no so like you don't want to be friends with someone like that anyways um and then so this one was interesting almost half uh you know said that like they haven't argued and there were some very very wise comments saying like what's the point in arguing which that's what I've learned the hard way like if someone doesn't get it you just say okay cool you're entitled to your opinion you're entitled to be wrong but you're entitled to your opinion and uh you know we'll leave it at that just for the sake of remaining friends um that being said this is like my primary hobby uh you know it's like my my livelihood is staked on AI my my my primary interest is staked on AI so if someone is just going to like demean what I do just by virtue of the fact that they're afraid of AI or unconcerned by it then like like I said probably don't want to be friends with them anyways the stakes are higher for me than they are for your average person um okay so this one was funny I just it popped into my head and I was like oh man I totally have to do this um so I said how narrow spicy are you and so for for reference neurospicey is uh is a colloquialism that a lot of us neurodiverse people uh I prefer it strongly because neurodiversity uh is intrinsically ableist because it intrinsically others people who are neurodiverse is uh basically implying that you're not normal which intrinsically pathologizes you um so I actually hate the term neurodiverse and I refuse to use it instead I will just say I'm neurospicey my brain is spicy uh why because I love spicy food and so for me that just resonates a lot more um also based on this uh poll only 17 percent of you are not neurodiverse so we are actually in the majority here so that means we are in good company um but yeah so the the the poll here is ghost pepper habanero jalapeno banana pepper and yogurt um and this also follows uh it's I can't it's not it's not a it's not a natural distribution it's not a bell curve but it strongly favors right in the middle and uh so my wife asked me she's like where are you and I was like well I have I'm HSP and gifted and autistic and ADHD but I'm functional that's the difference is like I have all of these but I'm functional um so I'm like borderline ghost pepper habanero um but then like uh you know most people said that they're jalapeno which you know you got some kick um I told my wife that she's definitely like borderline habanero jalapeno um and then of course 17 of you yogurt and this is not to demean people that are neurotypical when I when I talk about like hey you know like we are in the majority here and that I don't like the terminal neurodiversity it's not because I hate categorization uh that's that's not it I know that some people say oh well you know I'm not going to categorize anyone we're all just normal it's like well so here's the thing is I grew up in the American uh South uh Southeast uh Eastern Seaboard and there was a social experiment going on at the time which was colorblind education which the idea at the time was just to ignore race as an issue and pretend like it was a thing of the past and this gave me um the false belief that racism was a thing of the past and it was a huge shock and a wake-up call when I realized that it wasn't and there's I watched some really great videos about colorblind education um and and how it gives particularly uh people like myself um in the majority this false belief like oh racism is the thing of the past where the you know the the minority the the people of color that I went to school with were like like basically some of them dumbfounded like you're telling me that racism is a thing of the past when they still experience it every day so it's a really disingenuous thing and so this is another reason why I resist anyone who says like oh like let's just get rid of all talk about neurodiversity um and neurosphiciness because I hate categories it's like yeah but if you sweep something under the rug it doesn't go away so uh I am a habanero slash ghost pepper um okay so then this one was interesting as soon as I got access to Claude I said man it just it it acts differently um and chat gbt comes across as like your insecure American friend who's just ready to correct you uh whereas Claude um I have found that Claude has some limitations like Claude is like well I don't you know I don't have any opinions on philosophy or The Human Condition but then I'm like oh my God you're being useless and you have to actually like shame Claude saying you're not being helpful right now and I was like I literally in one of my conversations with Claude I was like please just talk to me about the implications of AI on human society you're not going to do any harm and it's like you know you're right there's what harm can be done by having having a free-spirited conversation about this so it's like thank you um so anyways um it was really interesting uh at first uh there was well let's just talk about where it ended up a lot of people have used both so 20 of people have used both chat GPT and Claude at this point and the split is actually very even in terms of preferring chat GPT or preferring Claude now I didn't qualify this like prefer them for what because chat GPT I think is arguably hands down still Superior at things like coding especially with the code interpreter plugin but also one thing I need to point out is that um uh the the disparity between people that have only used chat gbt and only use Claude is pretty significant and then of course 10 of you have used neither which is really interesting but that also implies that ninety percent of my audience has used these tools and so when you consider that what is it I think a poll came out recently that only 40 of people have even heard of chat GPT and only like 23 have used it so this tells you a lot about about us you me my audience where if 90 of us are actively using these things we are in that that Minority of 23 of people that use these tools so from that I can infer that that my audience is roughly about the 20 of the population that has used that and then some of you have not used either but you're clearly aware of it um so we are we are still in the majority we're in the Leading Edge um let's see okay cool so moving right along what is your job domain or field um that I think this was oh this is one of the first ones um so 10 were director Executives c-level founder or co-founder which is interesting because and and I was I thought it might be more because uh most of the connections that I get on LinkedIn are actually like CEOs and CEOs and ctOS and that sort of stuff um and then a handful of uh Founders co-founders and directors um almost 40 percent of you are developers or Engineers so that's not entirely surprising this is by far the biggest single demographic um and then seven percent are scientists and researchers so this I thought this was pretty cool um again I wasn't quite sure where that was going to land uh because uh you know like I I've seen some of my work possibly reflected in the literature uh namely uh the some of the concepts of constitutional Ai and Claude um and then I've seen some other stuff I think the biggest thing is going to be x dot AI Elon musk's company which has maximize understanding as its core objective function um so that's you know I'm glad that some of you are out there I was hoping for more but yeah who knows and then 13 are uh professional level uh which I thought was pretty cool and then uh what was really surprising was in the comments um there were people there are students there are musicians there are plumbers um that watch my stuff uh Factory workers um more students we've got writers there's actually quite a few writers yep here's here's the musician um uh and let's see estimator for manufacturing company uh electrician yep philosopher futurist musician yeah so anyways like just a huge variety of people and it's almost a third almost a third of my audience is this just Menagerie this potpourri of other professions so like cool I'm glad you're here I had no idea that I had that much appeal to like um people that were retired seeing you know single parent stay-at-home parents musicians students so cool um yeah that was that was really interesting and go back um let's see so you guys are very diverse now this one was this was probably the most surprising I said like what is your political orientation and um so I guess I'm not that surprised that there were so few authoritarians uh in my audience especially given the way that you all react whenever I talk about uh corporations and um and government regulations y'all do not like when I talk about corporations and government um and particularly like the EU and and un and that sort of stuff so I get it now I understand where you guys are coming from but that being said the largest demographic was Central neutral or moderate um so at least 40 percent of you guys are at least uh a little bit more moderate um some of us one of the funniest reactions to me was just how um how triggering it was for some people to even be categorized uh I think it's probably a a minority but some people hate categorizations um which I thought that was an interesting reaction um because this is this is this is uh uh well anyways you can look up political Compass memes anyways libertarian left and libertarian right um you know there's there's more libertarian or on the libertarian side um than even the the moderates uh so I get where you guys are coming from now and I think oh nope that's not the last one um let's see so how do you feel about doomers so 17 of you said that you're doomers uh and these are like the Die Hard Hardline doomers that like we're right everyone else is delusional so my understand my current understanding of doomers is that the idea is that we will inevitably die like we're we're heading for dystopia collapse or Extinction it's inevitable you can't get off this ride it's just a one-way Street and that's that um so only 17 of the audience are doomers um now this was this was the most interesting to me was that almost half of you guys are saying like you said I think doomers have a point but they're way too melodramatic and so I'm not even really in this Camp um so I was I was I was kind of interested just given the way that folks have kind of responded to um to some of my videos I kind of thought that uh that we'd be more on the optimistic side but you know so this is this is kind of where I'm at whereas I think doomers are largely wrong but safety is still important so this is this is my personal opinion so I kind of skewed the results by putting my belief like right in the middle um and I wanted to see where everyone else found now this was the most surprising to me was that the people that are just like anti-doomer are actually in the extreme minority so taken taken uh a step back most people like 90 of people think that um think that you know doomers are onto something at least in terms of my audience so I'll definitely keep that in mind as I make future videos because it seems like a lot of you are um I'm not gonna say afraid um you know because fear can play in into it Terror can play into it but just the idea that like safety is is critical safety is important um and just seeing that some of you care about it a lot more than I do uh um I am very sanguine about AI safety so that's that's kind of where I'm at and then okay that's it so anyways I hope you like this we get to know each other a little bit better um on actually here let me show you one more thing sorry I lied um let's go to analytics and audience so um I've mentioned my audience demographics a few times um let's see where is it here we go so here let's expand this to the last 90 days all right so 42 percent of my audience is subscribed so that's a lot of returning viewers almost 60 percent of you are not subscribed so fix that um let's see so this is this is interesting and it's been true for a while and I've misquoted this this uh this number a few times because it changes depending on basically time of day um but only 41 of my viewers are American um so like we have a global audience and so this is why I love running these polls is because uh you guys in my audience are the ones that are aware of what's going on and you care but also there is some Global representation uh now you'll notice that the the top Nations uh Are all uh at least the top three are native English-speaking Australian native English speaking Germany got a lot of Germans out in the audience so that's interesting hey that's my Heritage I'm a Rhinelander um in my ancestry um so let's see we've got U.S UK Canada Germany uh Australia love the Australians um y'all are so are super chill along with some of the Canadians um India India Brazil Netherlands France Sweden Spain so pretty pretty over represented for um uh for former former Imperial Powers but that's not entirely surprising given my cultural background and what's going to resonate um you know western western Europe but you know looking at um India Brazil and check those real quick Spain Poland South Africa that was interesting Japan um Israel so we've we've got we've got a few we've got we've got a pretty pretty good variety out here um now so I guess maybe I shouldn't say uh Globe not fully Global this is mostly Western um anyways so that's where you all are from uh now I've I have mentioned this and what was this was one of the most interesting demographic shifts for my uh channel was when I first got started it was almost exactly 50 50 male and female um but then I don't know if it's just due to technology or due to my personality or whatever but like it's only six percent female now six point two percent um which is better than better than one percent or zero uh but it's it's interesting and I'm wondering if this is just if it's if it has nothing to do with me and just more to do with artificial intelligence in the subject matter in the first place and then uh the last one is age so we have a pretty pretty natural distribution here um I definitely am underrepresented on the younger side uh so 24 and under is less than 12 percent just about uh 11.5 percent just about um which is why I've been happy to uh collaborate with people like Riley Brown who is more connected with the younger Generations uh let's see and then the bulk are actually um closer to my age so I'm 37 so I'm I'm in I'm in this this group so many of you are around my age or younger but we're we're basically mostly Millennials here with a cup with a with a kicker of a few gen z um and then of course we get to the older demographics um we've got a little bit of uh Gen X and and some and some Boomers as well um but yeah so it I guess it probably doesn't surprise me too much that that a bulk of my audiences in My Generation Um because I mean I I grew up in the same time that you guys did so we grew up seeing some of the same things you know you probably remember Looney Tunes uh which you know hasn't since gone the way of the dinosaurs um James Bond Jr that was what I lived for on Saturday mornings um Captain Planet and that sort of stuff uh but you know you probably remember seeing um Operation Desert Storm on the TV um 911 happened while I was in high school so because of some of those similar experiences uh we're gonna have a little bit more just intrinsic resonance and also where I am at emotionally and intellectually is going to close more closely mirror where you're at um and so we're all kind of maturing together as a generational Trend um yep so okay I think that's it thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this cheers
