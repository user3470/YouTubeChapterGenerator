there are exactly four reasons why machines will replace all human labor or at least almost all human labor those reasons are better faster cheaper and safer let's get right into it the first thing that you need to think of is in the Second Industrial Revolution where we introduced machines into industrialized agriculture we replaced the ox why did we replace the oxen with tractors number one the ox are more efficient machines took over because machines don't need rest they do break down sometimes but they don't take any time to grow they don't get old they don't get sick and die they do it like I said they do break they can be faster machines do not have the same constraints as biological uh draft animals now the cost as well machines are initially more expensive than animals because you know animals reproduce and all they need is a little bit of grain but in the long run because of all the various benefits to them they end up being much cheaper especially with the amount of product productivity output they have and then finally they're they're actually safer because animals one they have zoonotic diseases they can have unpredictable behaviors but also machines can get humans away from the work uh you think about a combine today where you're in a nice safe clean air-conditioned cab uh they're just going to be much safer overall and this is true for pretty much uh many many machines especially as they get larger with more safety features built in and then finally scalability you can Mass produce tractors you cannot Mass produce oxen so with this analogy in mind let's dive right into the rest of it better than us so one example is open ai's whisper so open ai's whisper if you're not familiar with it is a transcription AI service that has been proven to be better than human level transcription uh whether it's in multiple languages or noisy environments or otherwise low quality audio The Whisper AI is an example of AI being better than all human performance and what I mean by better than all human performance it outperforms literally like any 10 people and so this is just the first of a trend of many things in where in which AI is going to not just match human capacity but surpass human capacity uh like by a mile and so it's more accurate it's faster it scales it has availability and finally it's infinitely cheaper than human transcribers and so when you look at just this the fact that the first AI product that exists that is unequivocally better than all humans All Humans combined uh then you you extrapolate this out and say okay which is the next tool that's going to be better than all humans can possibly be faster than us so the example that I'm going to use here is Claude Claude has a hundred thousand token window which is about 60 to 80 000 words depending on how much formatting and what language it's in but it can read that entire volume of text in about 30 seconds uh that is obviously and Way Way Beyond any human capacity so this is and it's not just you know at human speed or twice the human speed this is literally hundreds if not thousands of times faster than humans and so between the reading speed the ability to then not just not just read that fast but also synthesize uh not quite as fast but still it can synthesize much faster and generate content uh then you combine it with the availability the low cost again it's better and faster in many ways it's a Claude as a chat bot is not better than uh than humans in all ways but when you when you have something that is this much faster it still adds a tremendous amount of value so imagine in the future when things are both better and faster and that's that future is coming quickly it's cheaper than us so I had a story from a client where they started using a code interpreter with chat GPT and they realized that it was doing uh as much work if not more than a full-time biostatistician so your full-time biostatistician might cost between five and ten thousand dollars a month uh depending on you know region and level of experience but chat GPT with code interpreter costs 20 a month so that is about a 400x in terms of saving uh so as you adopt these generative AI tools you're going to see immediate cost savings as well as new capabilities because maybe you didn't have a bio statistician and you needed one or whatever else uh chat GPT with code interpreter can do so this is going to increase your operational efficiency because again it can operate Around the Clock it's an it's uh incredibly scalable because this is just one person using uh chat gbt but if everyone in your organization is using something like chat GPT then everyone basically has a cast of full-time employees worth of Labor working under them the reduction in cost means that companies can then allocate the money that would have gone to those salaries elsewhere and the most important the Competitive Edge that this gives you if you're not doing this then your competitors are and so what we're going to see is as generative AI drives down the cost of a lot of goods and services you're going to fold because you're just not going to be able to keep up uh safer than us so this is uh data as recently as March of this year uh waymo reports uh 0.59 accidents per million miles uh which is compared to just shy of three accidents per million miles for human drivers so it's already uh self-driving cars are already several uh times safer than human drivers and so uh reduced accident rates live saved accidents uh and cost avoidance risk mitigation and this is just where it is today this is not including ongoing improvements as the Technologies get better so here are four examples of machines that are better cheaper faster and safer than us and we're just at the beginning of the generative AI Revolution the writing is on the wall as far as I'm concerned machines are going to can you continue to get better faster cheaper and safer and rather than just adopting one or two of these most machines are going to start having all four of these criteria now you've probably heard the you know human in the loop this is a myopic view um and as far as I can tell the reason that people like uh CEOs such as Sam Altman and others keep saying this is mostly it is just to placate people from panicking but when you look at the when you look at the trends that machines are becoming better faster cheaper and safer uh there's no reason to hire people anymore uh in fact if machine if and when machines surpass humans on these four criteria better faster cheaper and safer it would be unethical to have humans doing some jobs for instance once truck uh once uh once all driving uh cars trucks taxi buses once all driving is done safer by a machine it would actually probably be illegal or should be illegal for humans to drive because if machines are a hundred times safer than human drivers you wouldn't allow people to do that likewise if uh you know AI powered hospitals and robots and and robot doctors achieve you know better results 10 times better results than human doctors and Physicians and surgeons you wouldn't want to be treated by a human anymore and so this is one thing that I want to point out is that as machines become better faster cheaper and safer than humans it is not ethical to uh keep humans in the loop um not the least of which next is inefficiency by insisting on keeping humans in the loop you are creating unnecessary bottlenecks uh not only are not only that you're artificially inflating the cost of goods and services what we should be doing instead is working on getting humans out of the loop so that these these high-speed low-cost high efficiency machines can do more labor without human constraints and then again with safety concerns and competitive disadvantages if your competitors are doing it if your competitors are are reaching for AI tools that are better faster cheaper and safer and you're not guess who's going to be in business this time next year and guess who isn't so this is my Spiel better faster cheaper safer I hope you like this video nice and short and sweet and to the point have a good one thanks for watching
