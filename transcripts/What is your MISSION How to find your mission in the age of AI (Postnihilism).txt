morning everybody David Shapiro and I am back I'm back a little bit early but that's because I'm going to be spending uh a little bit more time making sure that my videos are more well thought out and a little bit more meaningful so the pace of my videos will be slower but the quality should be higher in terms of meaning and impact so with all that said let's Dive In today's video is about Mission and Mission is the most important thing in the age of AI and uh I imagine you clicked on this video because the thumbnail uh meaning is out mission is in so let's unpack this and I'm not going to bore you to death with post nihilism or anything like that I'm just going to talk about specifically Mission today so right off the bat the definition of mission that I use for this is Mission refers to a guiding purpose or clear goal that gives direction to one's life driving actions and decisions in alignment with a deeply held belief or value okay so let's dive in what does this mean what does it look like what are the characteristics of missions what are the kinds of missions that are out there and uh yeah we'll give a few examples as well all right so first the characteristics of a mission uh number one it's a clear goal it's a specific and unambiguous objective uh like get to the moon get man on the moon as JFK said uh they're bigger than oneself they extend beyond your personal interest to a larger cause the larger cause could be one other person it might be the entire planet uh as we'll see when we unpack some of these uh types of missions in just a moment they're not egocentric so this is a really important one is that they focus on the well-being of others rather than just self-enrichment that's one of the key things one of the most important uh characteristics of a good Mission and what we will also talk about toxic missions or negative missions uh they have a definitive outcome or result so in order to have a good Mission you need to clearly articulate what the result is um and so that's why I mean like clear goal uh but it also needs to have a definitive outcome like what is uh what is the out outcome look like vision for World change so in this case it is a specific alteration that you want to see in the world uh how do you want the world to be different if you succeed uh let's see the next one is it requires commitment and sacrifice uh so basically this means that it demands some some level of dedication or sacrifice if it's easy then it's not really a good Mission because if it's not challenging to you it's not taking you out of your comfort zone and if it's if it's that easy then anyone could do it but a mission is something that that you might be uniquely suited for or that you might uh be able to do better and we'll talk about the characteristics like how do you identify our mission in just a moment um it inspires and motivates you if a mission is something that is not inspiring and not energizing it's probably not a good Mission it might not even be your real mission it's also Guided by ethics and principles so uh if you if it's not couched in some sort of moral framework or morality and I'm not saying which which moral framework or which ethical framework or which values or principles you need to abide by because there's plenty out there as we'll talk about in just a moment but if it is not couched in some rigorously thought out and scrutinized moral framework or ethical principles then it's not a good mission and then finally it aims to solve a specific problem so these are the characteristics of a of a mission specific specifically a good mission all right so I know that uh Elon Musk is very uh polarizing and controversial but I like this example because this mission one of his personal missions is get Humanity to Mars and this one you can see that it is very simply and clearly articulated it is bold it is courageous and it meets all of these criteria uh it's got a very clear goal get Humanity Mars colonize Mars so that we're a multi-planetary species it's inspiring and motivating because it's a very clear problem and you know to be fair it's not entirely different from JFK's mission to you know get man on the moon uh it's just the next logical step uh it's bigger than himself because it's not just about like I want to get myself to Mars he does want to get himself to Mars but that's fine uh it solves a particular problem so the problem that he is trying to solve is the existential risk of having only a single planet uh I don't know that it's possible so personally I think that getting man you know getting Humanity to Mars is actually a pretty dumb idea so I want to I want to color that that while I uh while I use this as an example I hold up Elon Musk get Humanity to Mars as an example of a good Mission I don't particularly agree with it I think it's a dumb idea but that being said it still represents a good Mission and also one thing to keep in mind about missions is that not everyone has to agree I'm not saying that there's one universal set of principles or missions that everyone should adhere to but I did outline some characteristics of good missions it requires uh commitment and sacrifice obviously he spends a tremendous amount of his time and energy on SpaceX which means that he doesn't have that much of a personal life he's actually talked about that in uh in interviews where he's like you know people probably wouldn't want to be me if they knew more about my life because I'm actually pretty lonely um which you know if if his mission in life was to have a more Rich social life he probably could achieve that but right now he's got a mission that requires the sacrifice of family and social life and of course he's criticized for that because he's got what like 11 children now or something that he doesn't really give that much attention to uh and you could say that like that could be a moral failing and I'm not here to make any judgment on that but I'm just saying that he does have a clear Mission and he is making sacrifices for that mission um let's see and then finally it is rooted in principles and so again very controversial Elon Musk is a long-termist uh which basically says that the the the future humans that don't exist yet uh that that that they matter to uh and particularly when you look at the fact or the possibility that if Humanity does colonize multiple star systems there could be trillions of humans uh that exist in the future and so that we have a moral obligation to them even though they don't exist yet again I don't agree with long-termism I think it's an idiotic thing but the fact of the matter is that Elon musk's mission is couched in a particular moral philosophy now as a an example of a much smaller uh mission that many people might have uh this one is be the parent you should have had there are plenty of people that have this Mission some of my best friends actually uh you know one of my one of my friends she joked she's like We're not gonna make the same mistakes our parents did we're going to mess our children up in entirely new ways but the point is is that she's taking lessons from the failures of her parents and she's deliberately trying to do better so again very clear goal be the parent you should have had you've got an idea of the failures that your parents had and you study how to become a better parent it's bigger than yourself it's about sacrificing for a child and anyone who's a parent knows that that being a parent requires a tremendous amount of sacrifice time energy sanity money everything I mean cleaning spit up and changing diapers oh my God anyways it's not egocentric uh because again it's about if you truly put the needs of your child before yourself you might say that like oh well you know you get you get ego rewards because then you get to pump yourself up as a good parent sure you can be proud of your your achievement but if you're if you're just signaling that you're a good parent through your child that's probably you're probably not engaging with your mission correctly because there are certainly uh plenty of parents that do that that either live vicariously through their children or or use their children more like a trophy as an extension of themselves rather than paying attention to you know just being a good parent so being a good parent is more about virtue ethics it's about being the right agent um and so that would in in philosophy and ethics you'd call that a deontological uh framework where it's about being the right person and then whatever outcome happens is the desired outcome of that mission um now I in this case it does say you know have a definitive outcome or result but defining that definitive outcome or result is is harder so in the case of being the parent that you should have had the outcome or result that you might choose is I want my child to be as happy and successful as possible right you know I want them to achieve their Highest Potential uh in terms of Life satisfaction and well-being uh whereas of course many parents will choose other objectives I want my child to make as much money as possible I want my child to get the highest education possible they have other success metrics that are external to the child and so this is one thing that can be problematic is if if the definition of success that you set for your child is external that can lead to uh things like perfectionism and workaholism whereas if these success metrics are internal to your child such as I want them to be happy I want them to have uh well-being I want them to feel safe or whatever any number of things so again having a good Mission means articulating and clarifying these things to yourselves it solves a problem the problem that being the parent you should have had says my parents could have done better for whatever reason whether it was social or cultural or religious or family history or environmental factors whatever my parents didn't do the best job that they could have so I am going to fix that problem and I'm going to do better it requires commitment and sacrifice I already mentioned that and then finally it's it's Guided by ethics and values it is uh those value that value system is a commitment to being the right per the right parent as I just mentioned it's a deontological framework um now identifying your mission uh so by now you're probably like Dave I get it missions are good okay cool how do I figure out what my mission is so here's a few principles that you can use to identify what your mission is first of all first and foremost it's a calling not a choosing you don't Choose Your Mission your mission chooses you sometimes it can be a compelling urge something that you have that you just feel intensely that you must do that's how it is for me in other cases it's a reaction to something that happens to you um and I've got a couple examples in in uh just a moment uh your mission is usually scary it can be really intimidating it demands courage uh change and commitment um usually your mission seems like something that is insurmountable at first and I'll talk about uh my relationship to my mission uh and why it's just like it feels like climbing Everest but that's a good thing uh it's rooted in your gifts or experience um basically you either are born with or you develop unique talents and abilities or your life gives you unique experiences either of which or both uh it doesn't have to be either I give you energy and passion for for specific problems or issues or goals so the first example is um an old friend of mine her dad uh was a disabled veteran and he had some kind of chronic problem with his leg he was in a tremendous amount of pain because of an old injury to his leg and um they were very poor they were from you know the rural uh uh you know Countryside and uh he he he basically uh died slowly because he couldn't take care of himself and couldn't work um and so that that experience that pain of watching her dad struggle and suffer gave her the energy and focus to become an occupational therapist she saw a very clear problem and wanted to solve it and so that was her mission in life my mission in life um is that basically I've always been a problem solver uh that's what I built my my it career on and then I switched to AI and now I'm switching more to to uh Humanity more broadly but still in the context of AI and and the way that AI is changing everything and so my personal mission is steer Humanity towards Utopia it has taken a long time to to distill it down into those four words uh but that is my mission in life and that is my mission not necessarily because I chose it but because I looked at what resonated with me and what uh what my unique capabilities and life experience and and everything kind of push me towards and and again it took me a while to articulate that uh because I was like paying attention to okay like I'm working on artificial intelligence now I'm working on narratives now I'm working on philosophy what is the central organizing theme of all these things that I'm trying to do and now I have articulated it into four simple words just like how Elon Musk says get Humanity to Mars four words now I'm not saying that you have to articulate your mission as simply as far words and I'm also not saying that it's going to be easy it's taken me literally four years of work to get it that uh clear and simple now it also has to be aligned with values if you don't study values whether those are Christian values or Muslim values or or you know post-nihilistic values or long-termism or effective altruism or whatever um whatever Mission you pick needs to align with whatever values really resonate with you and and I'm and you can come up with your own value system as I did with post nihilism but that's not necessarily required there are lots of value systems out there but as long as you have a value system a moral or ethical system that you can use to align your mission uh that is a that is a good way to help identify your mission and finally it's a path to follow it's a direction it's you know your personal Mount Everest uh so that's those are some general principles that you can use to identify your mission okay so as promised I want to talk about some types of positive missions so just because you're not going doing something as ambitious as getting Humanity to Mars or steering Humanity towards Utopia there are plenty of other kinds of missions uh so number one creative missions um there are plenty of people out there that have a Creative Vision a friend of mine uh talked about how she wanted to write a beautiful uh coming-of-age story that is a great creative Mission um there's our service oriented missions whether it's volunteerism firefighting caregiving teaching these service oriented missions are really really good missions to have because they are intrinsically bigger than yourself one thing that I do want to say about service oriented missions is that some people are conditioned to self-sacrifice and serve others this uh often happens because they were very put upon in their families either they were required to take care of their siblings or even take care of their parents or other family members and they were forced to sacrifice their own needs and so this is why caregiving professions in particular are highly subject to burnout is because the people who gravitate towards caregiving missions they have a relationship schema in their head from their family of origin that basically teaches them your needs don't matter everyone else's needs matter more than yours so if service oriented and caregiving missions resonate with you my recommendation is examine your childhood and your family just to make sure that you're not going to burn yourself out I'm not saying it's a bad Mission it can be a great Mission but make sure that you don't harm yourself in the process fixing problems in society there have been plenty of people out there who have embraced or embarked on missions of fixing problems that they see in society whether it's solving a problem with technology or criticizing things George Carlin one of my favorite comedians of all time um he he didn't necessarily have a mission of fixing problems in society but he certainly identified them he loved calling out cognitive dissonance now the uh the thing is some of these kinds of missions for instance fixing problems in society can easily be flipped to negative or toxic missions so for instance some of the worst crimes against humanity that have happened in the 20th and 21st century were because someone saw a problem in society and went about fixing it in a particular way such as eradicating an ethnicity so just be to be mindful that you might have a problem but the method that you choose is really important Eugenics is another example of people seeing problems in society and going about it solving it in the wrong way and we'll talk about characteristics of toxic missions in just a moment overcoming barriers so whether it's gender equality civil rights uh sexual Freedom whatever um changing Society to so that it becomes more egalitarian more just or whatever those are also really great missions which is one of the reasons that like for instance social justice Warriors and wokeism it resonates so much but another thing to keep in mind is that a lot of people do virtue signaling where they will they will Don the trappings of having a particular Mission but really they're not necessarily doing it for the right reason they're doing it because they're lashing out from anger or they're coming at it from a place of insecurity or that sort of thing and I'm not saying that all social justice Warriors are like that I'm not saying that all wokism like is like that but a lot of it is and so uh make sure that when you are engaging in overcoming barriers or uh some some kind of problem like that in society that it's coming from the right place uh there's exploration and Discovery I used to think that I was a scientist and that I wanted to go explore the stars but it turns out I'm a Problem Solver now that being said people that do science for the sake of science or engineering for the sake of engineering to innovate and explore and find new information this is also a really good set of mission objectives and finally advocacy and activism uh one of my side missions is to Advocate uh for uh autism autism and neurodiversity uh basically to raise awareness for the lived experience of people like myself gifted ADHD autism whatever HSP so Champion championing a cause in order to raise visibility or to help push social change such as tolerance or dignity or whatever these can also be another set of good positive missions okay so what are the benefits of missions like why choose this thing because you know if it requires sacrifice and all these other things like why do it and so one of the primary things is that it gives your life a focus meaning purpose and structure having a mission around which to organize your life is just it's incredible it gives you so much to do in terms of knowing where your life's going it gives you a sense of agency and it also feels like it gives you control one thing that I realized recently about having a mission in my life is that working towards that mission for a long time I felt like I had no sense of control I had an external locus of control but one emotional breakthrough that I had recently is that mission gives you an internal locus of control it says this is my mission and this is what I'm going to do and this is how I'm going to do it um and it it it also uh facilitates you to have a very rigorous and structured or systematic approach to things so I just read a book called uh leadership in in turbulent times which is about several of the greatest presidents in American history and one thing that they all had in common was that they had the personal mission of becoming president now they didn't they didn't become president by you know charging through and just saying I'm going to be president I'm entitled to be president they changed themselves over time they used be working towards the presidency as the litmus test as the the the graduation that they matriculated against in order to judge their own progress and their own qualities and own merits as a person so Abraham Lincoln for instance is remembered as being very diplomatic but he was not diplomatic when he was a young man he was an an a-hole let's say he mocked people he was sarcastic he used his wit um and rhetorical skill to shred people like he was is pretty awful but he realized that that that quality would not get him to his goal and so he learned to change his behavior and change his approach to people and diplomacy in order to be the right agent uh to serve that mission and then through that hard work he was the right agent to help America Break Away From Slavery um it earns friends and affection so a former girlfriend of mine told me we were talking about video game characters and there was a video game character that she liked that I didn't particularly like and she's like well he's passionate I was like what like yeah he's passionate and passionate is really sexy and I'm like really like that was a wake-up call for me anyways having a mission in life makes you really attractive to people whether it's to romantic or sexual partners or even just friends I can't tell you the number of really interesting friends that I have earned by having a mission and like courageously embracing and embarking on that mission um and so yeah like it it does win you friends um now that being said uh there's a lot of learning along the way because like I've had I've allowed the wrong people into my life so because the the bigger of a Target you are the more that people will Target you for manipulation and exploitation so I have to be very Discerning um but that's you know that's a good problem to have honestly um because if if people want to be near you and around you then it's just up to you to pick and choose the good ones anyways getting lost down a rabbit hole it attracts help and support I cannot tell you the number of times that people have reached out to me and either in some cases they wanted something from me at first but by the end of the call they heard uh just how clear my mission was and by the end of the call or conversation they said how can I help you um that has happened to me literally hundreds of times now because my mission is so clear and it resonates with people and people want to support a mission that resonates with them it's deeply satisfying uh on the one hand I do still have some workaholism in me and so I always move the goal posts on myself as my wife points out um but that being said when I look back at what I have achieved and what I want to achieve it is very satisfying to know that I have lived a life of meaning and purpose uh and that uh and and accomplishment not for not for its own sake because here's an example Ronald Reagan was deeply deeply problematic for a lot of reasons but he he achieved a lot and one of the things he said is um what how did he say it was like there's uh it's surprising how much you can achieve if you don't if you don't mind who gets the credit and for me because my mission is bigger than myself and it's about the change that I want to see in the world I don't necessarily need credit for it and by letting go of the need for self-aggrandizement it's a it's more about like okay I'm having this effect you know it's a drop in the bucket because I'm just one people out of 8 billion on the planet all of us trying to you know make ends meet and and make the world a little bit better but at the same time it's very satisfying to know that I made these choices and these sacrifices um and that I've had a positive impact and then another thing is this is what I'm coming to learn and this is why I'm actually sharing this on my Channel about AI is that mission is a completely different narrative to the Dignity of Labor so if you don't know the Dignity of Labor is is a deeply American idea uh that was really codified in terms of public policy uh by uh FDR Franklin Roosevelt um while he was trying to tackle the Great Depression so the Dignity of Labor became the the default policy of America both culturally and economically because one of the things that he did was he did an experiment during the Great Depression which is one he just gave people money you know it was it was basically a very early experiment of universal basic income and then secondly they paid to have people do things like work in forests and what they found is that paying people to do work was better for their morale but it also achieved better results at the time this was in the what the the early 30s I believe and so the conclusion that FDR came to after doing these experiments was that Americans needed the Dignity of Labor and that's a difficult narrative to argue against it's been the de facto uh policy for literally a hundred years now or almost 100 years now but having a mission is an alternative narrative that doesn't require uh you know labor income um now missions are still a labor of love but it's a different kind of relationship to having purpose and meaning in life Okay so we've talked about positive missions and we sliced and diced them eight ways from Sunday let's talk about toxic missions okay so the will to power the root of all evil Frederick Nietzsche said that uh basically you need to become an Uber mention that you need to overcome and yada yada so his nihilistic output uh sorry Outlook emphasized the abandonment of Traditional Values and morality and said you know basically don't seek happiness seek power uh seek power for its own sake and so this he called the will to power and it says and he basically said that all people are driven fundamentally by a desire to assert and enhance their own power uh which okay that's one way of looking at life um but this nihilistic worldview literally underpins every toxic mission of the 20th and 21st century which we will go into in just a second and uh if you look at a the last century of consequences of this idea uh you will see and so basically I am just going to say that philosophy is categorically evil and yes I know that's a value judgment and I will die on this hill so here's why there are here are some types of toxic missions uh wealth and power accumulation for their own sake there are plenty of people out there I'm sure you can think of a few that want wealth and power just because they want wealth and power and they're not doing it for any greater purpose they're just that is the be-all end-all because they have adopted into this nihilistic nietzschean philosophy of don't seek happiness don't seek meaning or purpose just seek power and that's a really empty life but it also is often very harmful and destructive uh Revenge missions so there are plenty of people out there who feel righteously Justified um in in seeking retaliation either against individuals or entire groups of people um I'm not going to cite any specific examples but I'm sure you can imagine a few likewise hatred-based missions or negative emotions uh driving something so whether it's animosity bigotry any kind of judgment against a category of people or an individual or another family or whatever uh exploitation so basically if your mission is to exploit or hurt or undermine others that's probably not a good Mission it's probably a toxic Mission any egocentric mission is probably going to be a toxic Mission um if it's based on self-interest self-aggrandizement self-gratification or self-enrichment um and and that is the terminal goal is just to enrich yourself or to pump yourself up then it's probably not a good Mission and then deprivation missions and so basically deprivation mission is you're trying to fill a hole in your life um whether you were uh you you were deprived love and warmth at home or whether you feel entitled to something that you didn't get um if you're trying basically if you if you feel deprived of something and you're trying to earn it back that again is a kind a kind of toxic Mission it's an egocentric mission all right so what are some characteristics of toxic missions how do you know if your mission has switched from positive to toxic because remember many missions can slip into the dark side very easily uh and so some of the characteristics of toxic missions if they're self-centered as I just talked about they're egocentric they're self-centered they're focused on personal enrichment that sort of thing if they're driven by any kind of negative emotions whether it's anger Revenge even anxiety um so one thing that I realized is that anxiety can drive people to a lot of negative missions whether that is getting control of people uh so like if you have anxious attachment disorders uh then you're you're you might be very possessive of your partner or friends and you might set out the mission to have and control as many friends as you can and you might say that like you could even say that this underpins uh personality disorders like narcissism where anxiety and anxious attachment underpins most much of cluster B personality disorders now I'm not here to Dole out diagnosis and in fact I personally want to de-pathologize these things but that's a topic for another video lacking any ethical guidance to the absence of moral or ethical Frameworks or values if your mission does is not couched inside of some kind of post-conventional moral framework then uh it's probably that doesn't mean that it's categorically a toxic Mission but it is certainly at risk of being a toxic Mission if it is not colored and shaped by some value structure and again like I said earlier I'm not going to say that there's one value structure to rule them all there's plenty of value structures out there but as long as you have a value structure that is validated by culture and Society you're probably going to be in in better shape um inconsistency if if the actions that you take in pursuit of your mission are logically or morally or terminally or instrumentally inconsistent you probably have a toxic Mission or you might have a toxic Mission and the result here might just be that you need to clarify the outcome that you're looking for so I want to make sure that even if your mission slips into the toxic space that doesn't mean that it is categorically a bad Mission it could be that you're going about it the wrong way or for the wrong reasons short-term Focus um this is one of the biggest problems that I see particularly in the business world and also particularly in American politics because a lot of people are just looking you know for the next election cycle or the next quarterly report and so by incentivizing short-term thinking we will often kind of you know play this moral game of hide the cheese or whatever uh and so that is often one of the biggest problems is and it's also really easy to recognize is your is your focus short term or long term if it's long term it could be good now the biggest caveat to all this is if whatever your mission is if you switch into a mindset of the ends justify the means that is one of the easiest ways to switch to a toxic Mission um so these are some characteristics of toxic missions and again as I mentioned earlier there might be a problem that you want to solve in the world but if you go about it the wrong way or or with the wrong framework or for the wrong reasons um it can easily become a toxic mission okay so conclusion I want to talk a little bit more about Ai and Mission oriented living because again that's why I'm here AI is really forcing us to look into this mirror and a lot of people are kind of you know lost and confused and and Afraid of the future and so what I really want to say is that AI is going to allow all of us to live more mission-oriented lives so first AI is a transformational force um I have done videos and talked on podcasts about post-labor economics basically the assertion is that AI is probably going to dislocate or destroy permanently a lot of human labor and so then we're going to have to renegotiate our relationship to labor and you know the social contract of the Dignity of Labor and all that other stuff but rather than view AI as a destructive force you can view it as a transformational force so that we can transition away from routine so this is point two The Liberation from from routine so rather than getting on the productivity treadmill just so that you can pay bills and put food on the table and pay your mortgage payment and pay for your kids to go to school AI can disrupt all that meaning that we can focus on greater purpose bigger meaning uh and and our missions and so by saying like Okay well maybe we don't need the Dignity of labor but we do still need Mission we need a mission in life and for many people their job is their mission right or their family is their mission uh certainly you know one of the things that I struggled with in my I.T career was it was a good career it was challenging but it didn't serve my mission the happiest that I was in my I.T career was when I was working at Cisco Systems which is a Tech Giant and one of the customers that I helped support was NASA and so like knowing that the work that I did supported NASA that gave me a sense of purpose and Mission and once I left Cisco I never had that sense of mission again because all the other companies that I was supporting were not nearly as cool as NASA right and so but now having broken away from the corporate grind I am focusing on the biggest mission that I possibly can which gives me a tremendous amount of sense of meaning AI is also an enhancer of human potential um basically you know AI helps do a lot of things most of this of this slide deck was drafted with the help of AI now I didn't just say like write the whole thing for me I was I was driving I was steering but the words on the page are largely written by AI but it's doing what I told it to and I was able to draft this whole thing in about an hour uh likewise I use AI to help provide critique for my fiction uh as everyone knows AI is really awful at writing fiction but it's really good at providing feedback so it's a really great critique partner um and again that accelerates my creative Endeavors and it it brings me to a new level because if I tell the AI I was like be ruthless shred my work tell me everything I'm doing wrong it is happy to do so and it will be mean if you want it to be mean it'll also be nice if you want it to be nice um as a partner in these creative Pursuits so again there's a lot of debate right now about AI you know people using AI image generators and copywriters and stuff and certainly it is disrupting the industry out there but as I just I just um Illustrated whether your endeavors are intellectual or creative or whatever whatever Mission you have ai is there to help the existence of chat GPT and Claude and perplexity and all these other AI tools have greatly accelerated me in pursuing my particular Mission and that's what I want to really drive home is that if you look at AI as able to help drive your mission forward you're going to have a very different relationship with AI and you're not going to be afraid about losing your job uh with the exception of you need to eat right but that's why I also talk about post-layer labor economics because we need to make sure that people have their needs met but AI is going to make sure that we can all get our basic needs met very easily that's the goal and then finally democratizing opportunities here's an example I am not a visual thinker I if if I describe something the image that I get in my head is very different from what image generators produce but that being said uh using image generators gives me entirely new capabilities for artistic expression and communication and so this imagine that this expands to all other classes because here's the thing is writers going on strike I understand because their career is threatened however what I don't understand is the desire to gatekeep the art of writing um because as an artist as a creative as an intellectual I see it as intrinsically a good thing if more people are able to tell stories if more people are able to communicate their ideas their emotions uh their principles and their dreams with more mediums um granted that that being said I do understand the impulse to gatekeep because if you're special you want to stay special but I don't think that gatekeeping is a kind thing to do when there are people that want to express themselves they can't and so democratizing opportunities is another way of looking at AI as a Boon to humanity rather than a threat embracing your mission um so one of my calls to action is I want everyone who watches this video to embrace your mission I ran a poll recently and I think it was more than 50 percent of you said that you either uh agree that you have a very clear Mission or that you um or that you're you're near your mission that you're somewhat aligned with your mission um but if you're not for those of you that aren't um I want you to find your mission um think about the natural talents and passions that you have think about the experiences that you have in life that make you unique and that make you uniquely suited to pursue something uh it's a journey you know a lot of people say like oh it's it's the journey not the destination it's a journey just because your mission never ends this is something that I'm coming to terms with is that you do have to pace yourself because you can definitely burn yourself out if you uh go Full Tilt into your mission um now that being said it is about the experiences that you have along the way the friends that you make along the way build a community around yourself uh you know find people that agree with your mission there are there's been so many comments on some of my videos of people uh and and I was even like this when I got started nobody knew about Ai and so by building this YouTube channel that has over 60 000 subscribers now there is now a huge community of people that uh think similarly to me that have the same goals missions and Curiosities uh and so like having that Community to organize and I'm not saying that you need to have a 60 000 member Community if you just have six friends right that that agree with uh your mission or that resonate with it or that or that uh you know that are on the same Mission uh that's the way to go make a difference it doesn't matter how big or small of a difference you make but so this com this this concept comes from ancient Greece eudaimonia which is uh basically do the most good for the most people that you're you're able to that is within your capacity uh and that is a that is a good kpi for pursuing your your mission if you if you uh objectively improve the quality of life for just one person you're doing you're you're doing things right um and then start now there's uh it takes time like I said earlier in the video I've been working on my mission for the last four years since I kind of had an Awakening and started working towards it um there's no time like the present uh and and what I will say is it's been difficult it's been painful at times but um if I had to I would do it all again in a heartbeat just without a second thought and finally pick better leaders select Leaders with clear missions uh don't pick Loki because he has a clear Mission but it's a bad Mission it's a toxic Mission um but choose business and political leaders who have a well-defined altruistic mission that serves a greater purpose understand their motivations and the causes that they champion some billionaires out there uh their mission is clearly just make more money for the sake of making more money I'm not going to name any names but I'm sure you can think of a few there are others out there who do have altruistic missions granted they should all be scrutinized because a billion dollars gives them a lot of power um but holding them accountable with your voice by demanding high standards second the second Point here hold them accountable by expecting them to articulate their missions clearly and demonstrate commitment through action look for internal and external consistency actions speak louder than words evaluate them not just by what they say but what they do um and make sure that what the that their actions actually truly align with their espoused value Frameworks and mission objectives and honestly I think that every billionaire should have a publicly published Manifesto of this is my mission this is my value framework and here's my track record like if you want to if you want to stay a billionaire you should do that and then you should make sure that your your values align with that now one thing to say about like having a mission statement or or publicly espousing these things is they can be flexible like I said it's taken me four years to fully articulate my mission and my value framework and I'm sure that it's not going to be static right it's going to eval evolve as I learn and grow as a person so that doesn't just because someone learns grows and change doesn't mean that we should criticize them for that unless they go in the bad Direction then you should criticize them um we're in a new Global era using like if if all you take away from this video is the importance of mission missions are good missions are important and then you pay attention to that when you vote if you pay attention to that when you choose companies to do business with then that alone is going to steer Humanity towards a better future again my mission steer Humanity towards Utopia you can help do that by paying attention to missions and then finally Your Role is pay attention talk about it but more specifically vote vote with your regular vote vote with your wallet vote with your feet you know if if you work for a company that doesn't have a good Mission or even has a toxic Mission or you work for people that have toxic missions leave if there are politicians that have toxic missions vote them out if there are businesses that have toxic missions don't do business with them one example is Brandon Sanderson Sanderson who is a one of the richest authors in the world uh sci-fi writer or fantasy a speculative fiction writer um he refuses to do business with Amazon why because Amazon gouges creative types and so even though he's taking a financial loss he's doing it on principle and so that is a guy that is a man that I can get behind he's got a mission uh a creative Mission and it's and in this case it's about saying something uh at personal cost at personal expense that is the sacrifice that he's making to make that statement so that's what I that's what I see as an example of a good leader thank you for watching I hope you got a lot out of this cheers
