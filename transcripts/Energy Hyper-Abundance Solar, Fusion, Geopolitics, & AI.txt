hello everybody David Shapiro here with a brand new video today's video is about energy hyperabundance or nuclear fusion Renewables and how these will intersect with AI and quite a few other things before we jump into the video I just want to plug my patreon real quick if you want to support the work that I do please jump over I have a private Discord server for all of my patreon supporters and I also have a few higher tiers that allow for group interactions group chats and at the highest year one-on-one interactions if you'd like to consult on any of the topics that I talk about okay jumping right back into the video uh first we got to talk about the history of energy and we're not going to talk about the entire history of energy but just the recent uh history of energy so the energy consumption per capita over the last two-ish centuries went from about 90 million btu per year so BTU's British thermal unit which is a measure of thermal output which thermal energy is kind of the ground unit or the base unit of energy of course there's many kinds of energy but I don't need to unpack it for a physics lesson but just wanted to point out that is how we typically measure energy so around 90 BTU and then it uh all pretty much quadrupled to around 350 BTU peaking in the early or mid 70s and then kind of plateauing and then slowly pulling back a little bit so one thing that we need to understand about energy consumption is this thing called javon's paradox and basically javon's Paradox is what we experienced at the beginning of the industrialization of energy which is that when you make something more abundant uh whether it's a good or a service if you make the supply more abundant sometimes the demand actually goes up um more than you would think because usually supply and demand means that once Supply goes up demand actually goes down or the demand is satisfied so there's a couple reasons for this one reason is that in some cases there's unmet Demand right so if say for instance you know you're going without something and then suddenly electricity is twice as cheap it's like oh well now I can afford to run my air conditioner all the time now I can afford to cook with an electric oven so then you add more electrical appliances so your demand goes up as Supply goes up now that being said another way of looking at this is unmet demand or latent demand so once the latent demand is met that means that you're getting all of your energy needs met then demand should stop Rising now that being said that doesn't exclude the possibility of discovering more energy needs in the future so say for instance once AI takes off maybe our per capita Energy starts to go up again because AI runs on very expensive computers that consume a lot of power and so maybe maybe the unmet need for intellectual or cognitive labor through AI Automation and robotic automation that could be an unmet demand that as electricity gets cheaper that reduces the marginal cost of running more and more AI so we might actually see energy consumption per capita go up again I don't know one way or another I just wanted to point out that even though energy consumption per capita has been stable ish for the last 50 years that doesn't mean that it's going to be true forever but I'm making the assumption that the that the uh the compounding returns of increased efficiency and reduced demand will offset any further uh growth but I could be wrong now today our composition the composition of our energy portfolio is highly varied we've got nuclear we've got oil coal natural gas solar tidal wind Hydro hydroelectric and biofuel so biofuel is burning things like wood ethanol um and and other uh organic waste products or organic products is not necessarily a waste product uh the modern history of oil began in 1858 when the first oil well was drilled and it took about two decades for the Industrial Revolution to learn how to acclimate to this new fuel source because just because you have a new fuel source doesn't mean that you've got the infrastructure to use it it also doesn't mean that you have the tools or engines to consume that new fuel source so that's why you see here energy consumption had a little tiny bump when oil started being drilled but then it took another you know 20 30 years before you really saw the ramp up and that was because people were learning how to use this new fuel source now I'm not going to say that it's going to take equally as long or longer for us to learn to use new fuel sources but we were contemplating the same problem with for instance the hydrogen economy so for those of us who are old enough to remember up until about five or six years ago there was a lot of talk around the hydrogen economy the idea was that hydrogen had such a higher energy density per per unit of mass than fossil fuels that it would be a really ideal fuel source to replace petroleum now there's a lot of problems with hydrogen namely the infrastructure it's a compressed gas which is very very dangerous very hazardous so we would need to increase our safety standards moving it transporting it refilling all kinds of things become much much more difficult with hydrogen and so in that case it's not a matter of burning hydrogen or fuel cells or whatever it is the infrastructure of delivering hydrogen that was the problem and ultimately we collectively decided this is actually not a good replacement for fossil fuels not the least of which reason is because at the time the most efficient way of producing hydrogen is with fossil fuels so it's like okay this is actually not a not a solution so I just wanted to point that out as a modern example of testing new fuel sources even though on paper hydrogen is a very very potent fuel source because it's so difficult to use it's pretty much relegated to Specialty use cases such as in the space program okay so that's the history of energy consumption now we have to look at energy consumption on a global scale or the geopolitics of energy so this happens before my time I know I'm getting older but the 70s is still before my time there was uh what was called the oil shocks that happened there was two major crises in the 70s one in 1973 and the other in 1978 or 79 I don't remember exactly like I said I wasn't there anyways the the fact of the matter is is that a series of Wars local conflicts embargoes and other forms of global instability caused a widespread fuel shortages not just in America this is global um so these fuel shortages and high prices led to rationing and a lot of panic so a lot of a lot of people at our parents age and our grandparents age they remember this which is one of the reasons that they're afraid of things like hyperinflation and and that that sort of stuff is because they remember actually I remember my dad talking about having to sit in the gas lines right where there would be lines of cars more than a mile long waiting to get gas at the gas station because everyone was afraid that they would run out of gas and so this uh really woke the country up to how vulnerable we were and not just not just America all of the whole world how vulnerable we were to volatility and the supply of fuel fossil fuel dependence was identified as a major driver of instability and conflict and so this led to the Mantra energy security is National Security and this is still the explicit policy of many nations around the world so one one thing that happened in America is that we prioritize domestic oil production but then we also worked on securing alliances and other things and a lot of it was uh very underhanded so you might have heard the blood for oil kind of policies and of course no one in in Congress would actually call it that because that sounds very imperialistic and aggressive this is what protesters and um and critics of the government called it but so there's a few things that happen so the Petro dollar is a reference to a policy where America pretty much strong armed the oil producing Nations to price their oil in the US dollar which the on the on the positive side the benevolent side the stability of the US dollar should have helped the goal was hopefully to stabilize the price of oil but it also ensured that the US dollar was the global Reserve currency and you know just taking a big step back if you have one nation that is responsible for the global Reserve currency that's kind of unfair on a global stage which that has been an unpopular move for the last 50 years across the world you see ongoing reverberations of that for instance in the tensions between the US and China where currency manipulation like you know the US will accuse China of currency manipulation and China's like what are you talking about you've been manipulating Global Currency for 50 years right like pot calls kettle black don't be a hypocrite um it also resulted in a lot of proxy wars between the U.S and the Soviet Union uh particularly in the Middle East um when it was a matter of kind of fighting over influencer control of oil producing Nations Iraq and Iran are kind of two of the the primary examples and Iran was actually Central to some of those oil shocks in the 70s uh this was a very dark period in global history and particularly American history and it was not soon forgotten particularly by our parents and grandparents nobody wants to repeat any of that now one other thing that you need to know since I've you know kind of demonstrated the centrality of uh of petroleum to our to our energy consumption and energy use you need to understand the concept of peak oil now this is going to be brain dead simple to some people but it's going to be a New Concept to others basically any resource any natural resource is finite so however what we didn't know was how much there was at the beginning the idea was you just poke a hole in the ground and lots of oil comes out and it seemed like an unlimited resource right like you're never going to run out of lava in the planet right there so we thought at the beginning that oil could have been something that was effectively unlimited there might have been trillions and trillions and quadrillions of years worth of oil in the ground somewhere however um in the I think it was in the the 30s or 50s I can't remember um but the idea of peak oil was proposed that they said they they monitored the output of oil wells and they said actually this is not going to be measured in Millennia or even centuries each oil well each oil field is only going to be measured in decades in terms of output and so what we saw was that actually proved out to be pretty pretty accurate and so uh the production of oil in particular regions we're finding actually does become exhausted usually within within the century and in this case you can see that the USA our production our domestic production peaked just after uh the 1970s or in the middle of the 1970s and has been on a gentle downward slope ever since ditto for Europe and Russia um and uh and Central America same Middle East is still kind of stable-ish but they're kind of you know at their Crescendo um and then we do have a few new sources right so there's oil sands there's fracking um and then there's the deep water so like drilling oil um over uh places in the ocean for instance now that being said we are finding some new sources but they are much much much harder to get to they are much more expensive to get to and they're much riskier to get to so they're just not as sustainable and it's not as abundant as we thought that it would be now the other thing to point and to point out though is that our food production and our water production and a whole lot of other stuff even just transporting food so that you can get to it energy production our entire civilization presently still depends on oil so if you hold these two facts on one hand you are completely dependent upon oil or fossil fuels for your way of life and it is going to run out in the next few decades that is cause for concern on the uh at the same time our use of oil is harming the atmosphere harming the environment which will ultimately also harm us it's a lose-lose death spiral so this leads to the energy crisis that's that Catch-22 we need fossil fuels to to sustain our way of life it is also presently destroying the Earth and we will run out so it's actually three things um now that being said this is the underpinning of the energy crisis and there are plenty of alternative Solutions however all of those Solutions as I pointed out with the beginning of the Industrial Revolution it takes time to adapt to those alternative Solutions and in many cases some of the science isn't even proved out yet now the first and most popular is obviously solar solar requires special minerals and Material Science which means that it is not quite as easy to use um and even though solar power solar energy from the Sun is abundant um the production of solar cells is uh is still a constraint now it's getting better but solar has some other problems namely that it doesn't work at night and so you still need batteries or storage of some kind which is honestly the larger constraint at this point nuclear fission uh you know nuclear reactors are actually kind of unpopular for a lot of reasons they're geopolitically problematic because nuclear reactors used for energy production can also be easily converted to um as what's called a breeder reactor so a breeder reactor is used to breed other fissile materials that can be weaponized and so that's why there are um there are embargoes and other uh restrictions against um some Nations because it's like okay well we understand that you want nuclear reactors um ostensibly for civilian uses but we're afraid that you're going to use it for weapons purposes and of course again that's not very fair it's rules for me but our rules for thee but not for me because a lot of Nations like America and across Europe have nuclear reactors and we use them and we're like okay well we can have this but you can't it's super not fair um so that means we need a solution that is not geopolitically problematic another example is Thorium reactors so thorium reactors is an alternative kind of nuclear reactor that could have a lot of potential they haven't taken off yet and I'm not actually sure why I didn't look too much into it but I just wanted to make sure that it made it on the list wind is a really good resource for some reasons namely that it is available pretty much anywhere and you don't need any super specialized uh materials to get there just some fiberglass for the blades and then a typical generator and you're good to go unfortunately though it is unreliable because it depends on the weather it can also have some environmental impact of course you might have seen videos of you know bald eagles and other Wildlife like getting creamed by those blades because they move very fast and they are very like they're they're huge so it can be hazardous to Wildlife which means that it's not ideal um excuse me for many cases hydroelectric as we saw on the chart um or as I will show you on the chart hydroelectric is rising but again hydroelectric is geologically constrained you need a river that can be damned in order to use hydroelectric biomass I mentioned that briefly earlier which has to do with like things like corn um hydrogen already talked about that at length hydrogen is expensive to produce difficult to transport it represents a safety hazard even though it is far more energy dense than uh than petroleum and then there's tidal and wave generators again using the tides of the earth there's you know plenty of energy in the ocean that's available to us but you're geologically constrained coastlines and then finally geothermal is also very useful but that is also geologically constrained because if you're not near a hot spot and so a hot spot is where there's more lava or magma closer to the surface and the and the the ground temperature goes up much uh much faster as you drill down you might have to drill down several miles to get to a hot spot which means that it's very very expensive to implement geothermal there are some places in the world that geothermal is very practical and it's actually the most efficient source of energy that being said the Earth does have plenty of energy inside of it it's got um 11 orders of magnitude more energy inside of it than there is hitting us from the sun which we'll talk more about that uh later so the Earth hypothetically has more and plenty of energy for all of us just based on the natural nuclear reactions happening inside of it so we basically live on a giant fission reactor um bet you didn't know that nuclear fusion which I put at the end is one of the most Optimal Solutions because it is much much safer than fission uh the you cut off the fuel supply and the reaction stops instantly you can't do that with fission because fission requires fuel rods which are very heavy very bulky and if they get too hot you end up with a run Runaway reaction and they melt down that's what happened at Chernobyl that's what happened at Three Mile Island here in America and that's also what happened in Fukushima in Japan so at this point we've had three highly public reactor meltdowns which is one of the reasons that nobody wants a nuclear reactor in their backyard NIMBY not in my backyard um now that being said while nuclear fusion is hypothetically much safer and much cleaner it is harder to produce we haven't figured we have not yet figured out how to produce nuclear fusion reliably enough so if we can if we can get over that last hurdle it should be the most abundant source of energy for us and it should also be safe and scalable but again we're not there yet so solar is kind of the next runner-up let's talk briefly about the history of fusion so 1952 the hydrogen bomb or the thermonuclear bomb proved that nuclear fusion was possible we already knew that nuclear fusion was possible from observing our star right but the sun is billions of times more energy than we could ever produce use and it's also obviously beyond the scope of our engineering so the best we can do is just capture some of that Fusion Energy with solar panels so in effect solar panels are a type of fusion reactor or a fusion power but the hydrogen bomb proved that we could create with our engineering capabilities a runaway uh um and maybe not runaway but an exponential growth of energy from hydrogen Fusion in 1958 The Silo one was the first controlled Fusion experiment pictured here now even though it was the first experiment it was still like didn't work right we kept finding more and more problems of scale of energy of control and so this led to the kind of tongue-in-cheek Mantra the fusion is just 20 years away but it's always 20 years away kind of like how AGI has been for the last couple decades in the 80s and 90s we saw the first successful Fusion uh reactors where there was controlled fusion with large outputs of energy but the input was still greater than the output so basically it cost you know 100 watts of energy per 50 watts of energy out so you're still at a net loss which means that the reaction is not efficient enough now that's that's still an open question can we get more energy out than we could put in if we can do that ideally we would end up with a lot more out than in it may or may not be possible but the the the math is there if we can figure out how to how to crack that code then Fusion will be uh uh sustainable viable source of energy today there are dozens if not hundreds of fusion startup companies out there and they are being backed by Venture Capital um with billions and billions of dollars so the investment is there the market believes that we are close to cracking nuclear fusion then you look at China they have What's called the their East reactor their um I can't remember the advanced um something or other I can't remember what the acronym stands for but China's East is a fusion reactor experiment and it has set many records now one thing I I want to caution is that China often exaggerates their achievements um so I always take it with a grain of salt when I see news about China's East reactor but that being said um they have claimed to have shattered many records in terms of I think it was something like 900 seconds of stable Fusion uh which if it's true is incredible on the on the other side of the world we have eater or iter which is the international thermonuclear experimental reactor being built in Europe and either means the way in Latin by the way so eater is a huge International project a very very large-scale science experiment and it's not meant to be the first production nuclear reactor it is actually meant to understand the science of nuclear fusion so that way we can then optimize future ones because the eater plant is really really huge and really expensive but it's important to remember that it is not meant to be a commercial Fusion reactor it is a science experiment so that we can understand Fusion better and and conduct experiments on how to better achieve ignition eater is expected to have first plasma in 2025 so we've got about a year and a half until that time now solar as I mentioned is is a is a second runner-up in terms of viability and solar is effectively a type of nuclear fusion because it's powered by the sun which is a fusion reactor it's just further away the history of solar energy use actually starts much much older than you probably think and it starts with what's called CSP or concentrated solar power so using mirrors and lenses you can actually concentrate solar energy to do things like boil water set things on fire and this technique is actually thousands of years old um and it has also recently been explored as a scalable alternative to photovoltaics so photovoltaics is the what we currently think of when you think of a solar panel right you see the rows of the of the blue shiny solar panels those are called photovoltaics or PVS so if you ever hear PV or photovoltaic they're just talking about solar cells the photovoltaic effect was discovered in the 19th century so back in the 1800s uh they're horribly horribly inefficient and it wasn't the photovoltaic effect was discovered but it was not really thought of as like this is a way of producing electricity for almost a century um at least not in terms of commercial scale one thing is that photovoltaics are very useful because they have no moving parts and when you have no moving Parts it won't mechanically wear out which means that they're they can be much more reliable unfortunately one downside of photovoltaics is that the the mineral like the the the materials lattice of the of the uh of the actual solar cell can break down over time so solar efficiency tends to drop over years but that is another that is an open challenge that is being improved all the time so the commercialization of photovoltaics uh has recently become much cheaper much more reliable and much more scalable and so what you see on this graph here is that for the last two decades photovoltaic production has been increasing exponentially in the year 2000 we produced hardly any photovoltaics but now we're producing almost a quarter of a million uh megawatts worth of photovoltaic cells per year and that's only accelerating this cuts off in 2021 it's actually much higher than that today in 2023. so one thing to keep in mind is that 73 000 terawatts of elect of solar energy hits the Earth continuously this is roughly 10 000 times our current rate of energy consumption so in that in that respect uh there is a hypothetically a hyperabundance of solar energy hitting the Earth at any given moment if only we can Harvest it and obviously we're not going to harvest all of it because we don't want to live under a dome of solar power but we could hypothetically put some of those solar panels in space and beam the energy down to us if we wanted to there are ways of of achieving that such as with lasers and microwaves but you don't want to accidentally set you know your neighbor's house on fire by beaming down too much energy so I've talked extensively about the con concept of energy hyperabundance or eha so let's define it in more rigorous terms um you can see that we've achieved energy hyperabundance or eha when our energy portfolio when our energy ecosystem meets all of these criteria one it's renewable meaning that we can use it effectively Forever Without depleting the the its source whether it's Earth Resources or something else obviously if we're using solar the sun will eventually burn out but we're looking at time scales of billions of years rather than decades number two it's sustainable meaning that we can use it continuously without something becoming unstable damaging harmful or otherwise taxing it's scalable which means that it needs to be free from scalability constraints such as limited limited minerals or other exotic materials or resources so if something is scalable that means that we can go from zero to many many terawatts of generation without any major constraints like I said earlier one of the biggest constraints for solar is storage actually so that is actually a major constraint number four it needs to be clean which means preferably it has zero emissions and zero toxic waste if it doesn't meet those two criteria then that means you need to manage the emissions and manage the toxic waste which that's one of the biggest problems with nuclear fission for instance is that um is it spent nuclear fuel lasts for literally billions of years and it's toxic the entire time so it's not necessarily ideal it needs to be abundant which means that it is effectively Limitless which again the sun is effectively Limitless as far as we're concerned because it will be producing a huge surplus of energy for billions of years number six it needs to be efficient which means that it needs to have minimal thermal or material waste so again it comes back to the outputs the the on the unused or undesirable outputs number seven it needs to be accessible which means that it means it needs to be globally available to everyone as we mentioned there are certain Geographic constraints such as with geothermal but there's also geopolitical constraints as with nuclear fission so number eight it needs to be affordable meaning that it can't be more expensive than our current Solutions it's actually got to be cheaper and ideally energy hyperabundance means that the marginal cost of power generation is near zero so imagine a future where the energy that you need is as free as air basically that is um that is the the high goal I don't know if we'll ever ever get there because nuclear reactors Fusion or otherwise are always going to be somewhat expensive to build which means there's going to be some cost associated with it but the idea is that we get it as efficient as possible so that the price approaches zero it'll never actually be zero number nine it needs to be stable so we need to avoid those availability shocks those price shocks and it needs to be stable globally as well and then finally 10 needs to be completely safe which means that it's not liable to blow up it's not going to hurt the environment it's not going to be dangerous to Wildlife that sort of thing and that um and even if it's not perfectly safe like intrinsically at least the risks need to be easy to mitigate so that it is easy to make safe if we can meet these 10 criteria we will have achieved energy hyperabundance and as I mentioned earlier solar infusion represent some of the best options to get there although there are still some constraints there namely with battery and storage technology and the fact that we don't have sustainable Fusion science yet now the benefits of achieving energy hyperabundance are numerous first and foremost reducing geopolitical tension many of the conflicts around the world in the 20th century and up to today are at least partially driven by or mediated by fossil fuels so for instance in the present war between Russia and Ukraine or rather Russia's invasion of Ukraine one of the things that was that Russia relies on is its natural gas exports which it gets billions and billions of dollars per day from exporting Natural Gas which is it can then use to um pay for its War on the other hand there is alliances and other tensions about oil supplies so for instance one of the things one of China's biggest vulnerabilities is its dependence on external sources of oil which again that is um that is something that is not good for China because it's something that they might be afraid of in terms of if geopolitical tensions rise the next thing is food security so this is also Universal your food production everything that you eat depends at least somewhat on fossil fuels and that includes even if you grow your own food on your own land things like fertilizer and other supplies are are totally dependent upon fossil fuels so in order to Inc to secure the global food supply we need to get off of fossil fuel this has nothing to do with China or Iran or Europe or Russia or America this is just for the sake of the human species we need to get off of fossil fuels so that we can continue to eat the same is true for water so whether you're transporting water or purifying water and making it potable um you know unless you have a rain barrel you are dependent on fossil fuel for your water and so energy hyperabundance could help us solve things like water scarcity permanently number four this is again more broadly is that energy hyperabundance would fuel a tremendous amount of economic growth for the foreseeable future much of the economic growth we've seen over the last two centuries was fueled entirely or primarily by fossil fuels so if you can imagine that we have 10 000 times more energy um you know in 10 years from solar infusion then the amount of economic growth that that could drive is in totally insane number five is climate change mitigation so if we have hyperabundant energy such as from a lot of solar and a lot of fusion then that allows us to power much more expensive Technologies such as atmospheric CO2 scrubbers that allow us to pull carbon from the atmosphere and therefore mitigate some of the worst effects of climate change and we'll talk a little bit more about how that could be done in in a one or two slides number six is environmental preservation so right now a lot of the resources that we consume have a cost on the environment however if we have energy hyperabundance that unlocks new capabilities of synthesizing the resources that we need whether it's through recycling or more energy expensive processes but that makes it that basically means that we can leave the environment alone in more cases and make our own Resources with this hyperbund and energy and then finally number seven I know you've been waiting for this is peaceful coexistence with artificial intelligence so energy use is something that humans and machines will have in common we will both depend on production and consumption of energy now because of the concept of instrumental convergence and artificial intelligence which is basically saying that artificial intelligence is still a machine so it's still going to have some machine-based needs such as need for energy compute and so on if we don't solve energy hyperabundance and AI you know artificial super intelligence wakes up into a world where its energy Supply is not guaranteed and stable it might say I should actually take that from humans um but if we if we achieve energy hyper abundance before that then the AI wakes up and says oh we actually don't have to worry about energy at least not for the foreseeable future so then the friction between artificial intelligence in humans becomes inconsequential or at least less consequential for the foreseeable future so one of the reasons that I feel so good about this is because again looking at the ramp up of uh our portfolio of renewable energy over the last um six decades or so um back in the 60s we had about 1 000 terawatts of hydropower now we have 4 000 terawatts of hydropower in addition to 3 000 terawatts of other Renewables such as wind wind solar and others so we are quickly ramping up now that being said when you look at the total energy portfolio we are only producing uh somewhere between five and ten percent of our total energy needs with Renewables the rest is still nuclear natural natural gas oil coal and traditional biomass many of which are harmful uh or carbon positive not rather than carbon neutral or carbon negative and so you see here we're at seven thousand terawatt hours of Renewables just over actually closer to eight thousand but we need to get to 160 000 terawatt hours in order to um in order to meet just current demand and of course this demand is still going up over time because again we are finding new uses for energy and so as our supply goes up our consumption also goes up so we do have a long ways to go but the trends are moving in the right direction so let's talk a little bit more about nuclear fusion we talked about the history but let's talk about the actual numbers of it nuclear fusion is utterly incomparable or incomparable to other energy sources because of its energy density and so energy density as I mentioned is you know how much how much energy can you get out of something per kilogram so gasoline is about 13 000 watts per kilogram right and gasoline is a is the most uh widely used fossil fuel use it in your cars you use it in your tractors use it everywhere uranium is 22 billion watts per kilogram hour so that is um that is like more than a million times more energy dense than gasoline so this is this is why nuclear fission was seen as the solution that everyone needed they said oh well with just you know a few thousand tons of uranium we can power the entire human race for you know several years uh that being said due to the problems that I outlined earlier uranium-based fission is problematic because the waste products are very toxic and difficult to manage uh and then finally there's the geopolitical uh concerns about weaponization nuclear fusion is 177 billion watts per kilogram hour or Watt hours per kilogram so it is still several times more energy dense above uranium so it's even better than nuclear fission in terms of uh in terms of energy density but then of course I also outlined that it is much safer for many many reasons if we can figure it out and this is actually a fusion reaction Happening Here and then anti-matter is hypothetically the most energy dense substance possible because that is literally um if you mix matter and anti-matter it they nullify each other and become pure energy and so that is 25 trillion watts per kilogram um so that is again several orders of magnitude higher than Fusion so maybe we'll get there one day but if you ever wondered how uh the ships in Star Trek were so powerful and they could move across space it's because they were powered by anti-matter which is many many orders of magnitude more energy dense than any fuel we have today we might get there we might not there are many advantages to nuclear fusion for instance the fuel sources are abundant hydrogen and deuterium are easy enough to extract from seawater and then tritium which is another isotope of hydrogen I actually didn't realize this but it's actually relatively easy to synthesize by breaking lithium apart um the waste products are cleaner if you fuse hydrogen you get helium which you can actually use helium for plenty of other things but also helium is non-toxic much much lower risk of meltdown in fact we have to put so much energy into the fusion reaction in terms of achieving ignition you just switch off the magnet that that um that wraps around this the reaction stops you cut off the fuel the reaction stops there are so many ways to kill a nuclear fusion reactor that like it's pretty much impossible for it to blow up or melt down I'm not going to say it's totally impossible but in terms of mitigating risks way way way easier and even if it does blow up the fuel is completely non-toxic so a fusion fusion reactor explosion or meltdown yes it would release a lot of heat but there's not going to be any residual you know nuclear fallout basically so because of this nuclear fusion represents like the Pinnacle dream of removing energy bottlenecks now that being said you know nuclear fusion is always 20 years away we might go into another Fusion winter just like how AI has gone into many AI Winters which if we cannot get that input is less than output for Fusion it's still a no-go right it might be a dud kind of like how the hydrogen economy was a dud I hope that's not what happens but fortunately we've got other Renewables ramping up right now including wind and solar now one thing that a lot of people are concerned about because I've mentioned Fusion in quite a few of my videos is what happens with the Surplus Heat now uh there's first and foremost there's many many industrial uses for the Surplus heat from nuclear fusion which can then be used to offset other production so you might end up with a net neutral in terms of that that Surplus heat so for instance desalination of water you can use that Surplus heat from from nuclear fusion to just boil sea water and don't boil it with the fish in it right you pipe it from the ocean make sure there's nothing alive in it but you boil the sea water you end up with fresh water and then salt and other minerals that is a very very heat intensive process which would be a really a good use of waste heat from um from nuclear fusion there's also plenty of other industrial processes which could use that waste heat such as smelting iron or other metals another thing is that by consolidating that the use of that excess heat you offset a lot of other industrial processes which means that you're just generating heat over here well instead of generating it in two places you generate it in one place and so then you have a chain of industrial uses for that additional heat now that being said if say for instance we increase our usage by another thousand X right if we you know we use um 7.3 terawatts of of energy right now what if we go up to you know seven quadrillion Watts um then the then the concern is okay well what happens with all that excess heat won't that cook Us Alive you know won't Earth become a hot house or a greenhouse one thing that you need to keep in mind is there's several orders of magnitude here even with all the energy that we are consuming today this is less than 0.01 percent of the total energy delivered to us by the Sun so yes if we go up a thousand X that is going to be you know uh 10 right that could probably cook us now that being said thermal equilibrium is maintained by um primarily by either reflecting excess heat from the Sun back into space or by just radiating excess heat from the Earth to space and as I mentioned earlier the Earth is also heated from within so the Earth contains 10 to the 31 joules of energy and energy human product or energy production by humans is only 10 to the 20. so even if we go up a thousand X if we go up to 10 to the 23rd um then that's still going to be several orders of magnitude less than the amount of energy the Earth already contains and successfully radiates out to space so no matter pretty much no matter what we do unless we try and boil the entire oceans um the human impact even from using Fusion is going to be pretty trivial and even if we do have excess heat that um that we need to manage we can we can radiate it directly to space um and and we can also modify the uh the atmosphere to reject even more excess heat and so that leads to the idea of a global thermostat which we'll talk about in the next slide anyways so the short version is even if we go up 10x or 100x in terms of total current energy usage that's still going to be not that big of a deal and there are ways to mitigate it so the global thermostat idea is that if we have a surplus of energy at our disposal we can use that energy and other engineering tactics techniques to maintain optimal atmospheric conditions and what I mean by that is modeling modulating the amount and kinds of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as well as dust in particulates because those have a big impact on absorption and reflection and so basically we can modulate the insulation properties properties of the atmosphere as well as the amount of thermal capture so this allows us to train to to um not train to change the atmosphere's characteristics so that we use that energy out versus energy in to maintain an optimal balance of of thermal exchange so the total system energy in the atmosphere is responsible for all the climate change that we're worried about for instance hurricanes are effectively powered by thermal energy from the Sun rainfall evaporation all of that is is rooted in thermal energy which then of course Powers the biosphere and again the radiative energy from the Sun is what helps plants grow which you know provides food and oxygen and all that stuff so there's a few other conditions I mentioned dust and particulates in the atmosphere are also important vegetation on the surface such as you know grasslands versus desert versus ocean this has a big impact on the Albedo which is the reflectivity of the Earth's surface and then also clouds cloud cover can also change how much energy is absorbed versus reflected so nuclear fusion right now it is beyond our engineering capability to modify that in any kind of meaningful way with the exception of continuing to burn fossil fuels and adding more carbon dioxide and other grain greenhouse gases to the atmosphere but even then that's just a byproduct we're not doing that on purpose nuclear fusion however would give us so much extra energy that we could manage each one of those variables we could evaporate more water if we wanted to to you know increase the water content of the atmosphere we could scrub particulates and CO2 from the atmosphere to modulate it that way with the hyperabundance of energy produced by Fusion climate change is 100 solvable and in fact we could we could tame the entire climate now that being said I can hear a lot of climatologists meteorologists saying oh my god do you have any idea how many variables how much science needs to be done so that we can do that safely because we don't want unintended consequences right we don't want to make a change that results in no rain falling for instance or we don't want to make a change that results in um you know 12 hurricanes happening globally simultaneously because that's within the realm of possibility um as I mentioned earlier energy hyperabundance will reduce uh competition between nations but also between humans and machines energy hyperabundance is one of the most important ingredients to creating durable Global Peace now one thing you might say is like oh well but Dave if we have energy hyperabundance then we're just going to have more food more water and the population is going to grow again until the until you know the carrying capacity of the planet goes up and we meet that new carrying capacity and then instead of 8 billion people there's going to be 50 billion people and words are going to be worse could be yes I do however think that other factors are going to slow population growth so I don't know if you've seen some of the interviews that I've been on but we talked about it and so in one of the things that that curtails population growth is not actually the carrying capacity of the world but it actually has more to do with social dynamics which is that as education goes up fertility rates go down that is a globally true Trend so even in places where they hypothetically have the room and money for more children they still choose to have fewer children so as education goes up and a few other metrics fertility rate goes down so I suspect that we will control our own population rather than just mindlessly reproducing like rabbits I do as I mentioned at the beginning of the video I do suspect that energy use per capita will remain stable and even though we might use more energy per capita for some things say for instance cleaning the atmosphere I think that that any increases will be modulated by increasing efficiency and so what I mean by that is that you notice how in that graph at the beginning where energy is per capita kind of peaked in the 70s energy use has continued to go up because the population has continued to go up but I suspect that um that the the trends going in opposite directions will kind of neutralize each other and even if it doesn't solar infusion represent energy hyperabundance that could support you know energy use per capita 10 times 100 times higher than it is today which I won't I don't suspect we're going to go there certainly not quickly uh and the furthermore energy hyper abundance represents a guarantee of meeting our basic needs of food and water which will of course reduce uh conflict globally and will also reduce human suffering now that being said I did say that this is a key ingredient but it is not a complete solution so there are between humans there are plenty other uh areas of conflict such as ideological differences and territorial territorial disputes so for instance the current war between uh Russia and Ukraine is primarily about national identity excuse me it's about national identity and Russia trying to rebuild its former Soviet Glory that has nothing to do with resources although Russia getting access to the Caspian Sea could be part of that um so geopolitical uh Geographic considerations can also Drive conflict which has nothing to do with energy another problem is that creating energy hyperabundance could still be used for negative goals for instance the production of weapons or even the use of energy-based weapons like lasers Firepower or weapons are about the directed application of energy of some sort uh and so what I mean by that is that what does a bullet do a bullet is fired from a gun with chemical energy and so you put a whole bunch of chemical energy you convert it into thermal energy which is then transmuted into kinetic energy and you launch a bullet out of a gun going faster than the speed of sound that is an application of energy that it can be weaponized if you have hyperabundant energy in the form of nuclear fusion you could put that into a laser or a railgun or anything else that is super energy intensive so that being said while I did say that nuclear fusion is not intrinsically used in weapons it can still power plenty of weapon systems which the more energy you have the more destruction you can make and so this is why when you look at the energy density of uranium it's like oh well with a few thousand tons of uranium we can destroy the entire planet great with a few thousand Fusion reactors we can destroy the planet thousands of times over so that's not necessarily the best thing so that's something we'll need to we'll need to keep it in mind and then of course there's plenty of implications for artificial intelligence first and foremost is that artificial intelligence training it is very very energy intensive running computers to run artificial intelligence is also very energy intensive and because of that once we achieve AGI it's probably going to want a stable power supply uh which is uh defined by Instrumental convergence I mentioned that earlier and therefore energy competition between humans and AI could be very very problematic and if we don't solve that it would almost certainly be catastrophic in other words the AI might say we need the energy more than you need it so we're going to take it all and then you know humans you can go starve for All We Care uh now that being said if humans are seen as cooperative and beneficial towards solving uh energy abundance then AGI has less reason to attack expand and seize control but even even here energy hyperabundance is not a complete solution to the control problem but it is a necessary component so the conclusion is that energy hyperabundance is necessary but not sufficient for um the Perpetual existence of the human race and again this is all a foregone conclusion right there's a reason that Nations have been dumping billions of dollars into Fusion research and solar subsidies for the last few decades because the um all the people all the decision makers in the halls of power say hey if we don't solve this we're doomed it's really that simple so my personal Outlook even though I've outlined quite a few problems is that I am incredibly optimistic here is a cutaway of the eater reactor you can see that it is five levels um and it is an enormous scientific experiment when you see this much energy and money and resources and expertise being pointed at a problem even if this even if this version doesn't solve it for good we're going to learn so much about nuclear fusion just from this one experiment and of course it's not even the only experiment going on in the world so with that being said I am very optimistic that these problems are all solvable that we're moving in the right direction there is still plenty of work to do and time is of the essence because with the rapid rise of artificial intelligence we have not yet solved energy hyperabundance which means that artificial general intelligence will compete with us for energy so we need to figure that out not just for our own sakes but for the future of humanity and cooperation so thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this video
