The Singularity has been cancelled I'm sorry everybody time to pack it up and go home now I'm actually kidding just a little bit but there are a few things that I want to unpack about the singularity and some predictions that people are making and just kind of how people engage with the idea of technological progress and exponential curves so first we need to unpack what is the singularity The Singularity is a term that is thrown around a lot and a lot of people actually are not familiar with the real definition they haven't read the book uh but it's basically the hypothetical point in the future where uh technology advances faster and faster and it becomes uncontrollable and irreversible but really the key thing that I want to draw your attention to is unforeseeable changes to human civilization it doesn't mean that there's going to be an event horizon Beyond which all technology and all you know all bets are off and Technology can do anything that you can possibly imagine now here's some of the points of evidence that lead up to this first exponential growth so right now we have things that seem to be growing exponentially or logarithmically namely stuff like Mo's law now uh just because things uh are are some things are measurably increasing exponentially other things are not or even if they are growing exponentially it doesn't mean that it's useful so what I mean by this is consider the fact that computers are literally millions of times more powerful than they were during the space race but life is not millions of times more different uh likewise the amount of data that we're generating is going going up exponentially but it's not really having that big of an impact on the way that we live or even civilization so despite all of these things I want to like kind of temper your expectations about the future and it is kind of disappointing um I would absolutely love uh for there to be a point in the future where we basically become you know Godlike entities because we have mastered all of time space and energy but that just might not be in the cards for us so why canceled what did it do wrong did it did it make a bad tweet on Twitter or what no that's not what I mean uh so first is lwh hanging fruit we have been meticulously picking all of the technological and scientific lwh hanging fruit that we can uh and we've been doing this at an increasing clip uh over the last century now science has absolutely accelerated in the last even just the last decade but is this acceleration permanent I don't think that it is and especially when I talk to my scientist friends and I have quite a few scientist friends they usually just kind of roll their eyes whenever I mention Singularity they're like whatever science is hard and it's getting harder fast uh some of my friends that that they talk about like yeah like there's more papers being published but like each paper is smaller and smaller in terms of what it actually achiev achieves and so when you consider like maybe there's some diminishing returns maybe there's kind of a vicious cycle there's just not as much to like unpack about the universe anymore so speaking of that diminishing returns so I just mentioned uh papers uh you know the number of papers is going up exponentially the number of like fundamental shifts in thinking is slowing down uh and even if you look at the number of AI papers that are coming out Mo I mean there are entire papers that are dedicated to like one prompt strategy uh which to me that's worthy of a tweet not a scientific publication um and then of course you know like sure I've I've had arguments with people on LinkedIn and other places about like yeah to anyone who's an experienced prompt engineer a lot of the things that passes papers um they're not worthy of that but for some people that they only consume information from that particular source and so like scientific Publications particularly in the AI space is basically just becoming a Twitter for scientists and engineers and it's like that's kind of disappointing but it also is just that's the pace of things and that's the way things are being done another thing that I really want to point out is Milestone gaps so the the amount of work that is required uh in order to get to the next Milestone is increasing exponentially as well so while we have some exponentially increasing uh Technologies we need those exponentially uh increasing Technologies just in order to get to the next Milestone uh and so you know I've got some Concepts here like complexity ceiling uh as you pick the lwh hanging fruit the fruit that is remaining to be picked is way higher and so you need increasingly more sophisticated Technologies and scientific understandings and effort in order to get to that so for instance I don't have a chart for it but the cost of drug Discovery has gone up from the tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands to Millions to to literally billions of dollars for uh many new drug discoveries today that is an exponential increase in cost just to discover new drugs and yes Ai and other exponential Technologies are making it a little bit easier but that's just to keep Pace with where we are this is called Red Queen Theory um in evolution which is basically you have to run as fast as you can just to stay right where you are uh and so because of these diminishing returns I suspect that uh put it this way I don't see any reversing of this trend anytime soon now another thing is that there's probably just mathematical upper bounds to the laws of physics and artificial intelligence and technology so what I mean by that and I've talked about this in recent videos but there is a hypothetical maximum limit to the uh to the like efficiency of computers it's called the land hour limit but we might not even be able to get remotely close to the land hour limit and then you know yes there is the hypothetical aspect of quantum Supremacy Quantum Supremacy might be able to uh move the needle on some things but it also might never really compete with classical Computing we don't really know just kind of like how analog circuits and digital circuits they don't really like you can compete but it's almost kind of like comparing apples to oranges they just do different things uh there's also some EV some growing evidence that there might be an intelligence ceiling to AI Sam Alman of all people said the the age of large models might already be over and it feels like it just got started and so I've talked about this quite extensively in other videos I call it terminal race condition where basically there's a tradeoff between model size and intelligence versus speed and efficiency and in more and more often than not you don't need a gigantic model you need a smaller uh model that is fine-tuned for a particular purpose in order to achieve whatever goals you need and so like there's even if you can hypothetically make an AI more intelligent it just might not be practical it might not be even necessary or useful uh and then finally there's uh useful knowledge which I've got a chart coming up on that but there is a finite amount of knowable stuff at least useful stuff that the amount of data in the universe is hypothetically infinite but the amount of useful and valuable data is not infinite uh now finally what I want to talk about is at least in this in this section of the video is sigmoid curves many many many things in nature follow sigmoid curves neuron activation population growth learning curves scientific progress and in all likelihood AI development will eventually be following a sigmoid curve now in the early phases of a sigmoid curve it looks exponential and if you extrapolate that curve based on early results it looks like it'll go that way forever however eventually a sigmoid curve reverses so this is the heart of this video so I want to talk about this is a sigmoid curve this is like basically an activation function for you know a neural network or a neuron or population growth or whatever so many things in nature follow sigmoid curves the question is where are we on this sigmoid curve we might be right in the middle we might also be near the end of the curve uh particularly when you look at um at the basic Sciences uh and I'm not saying like oh we're super close to like discovering everything what I'm saying is that in order to get to that maximum part where we have that plateau of where we've mastered all of basic Sciences it's going to get exponentially more difficult and expensive to get there uh and we're already seeing this in many Sciences uh but you know it might feel like we're still at the beginning of the curve but the the problem with sigmoid curves is that if you're in the middle third you kind of don't know how far along you are because the the slope of the curve is not very different um from one point to the next uh and so we're not really sure like how far along we are and it might be impossible to predict how far like because if we are in the bottom third still like if we're if we're down here then it's like okay well Dave like you're completely wrong and even just when we get to the midpoint that'll feel like the singularity let alone when we get near the end but personally when you look at the rate of change uh in terms of the way that Society has changed societ has already slowed down drastically like I mentioned at the beginning of the video we have space flight we have you know infinitely more powerful computers than we used to we have Alpha fold 2 we We've Got Deep Mind we've got all these things and we've got just this exponentially uh increasing amount of technology and science and understanding but Society hasn't really changed in 10 years or 20 years or 30 years you watch videos of like you know what happened in the '90s and it's like we more or live the same way uh and so I'm I'm not convinced that that the singularity even even uh the the formal definition of the singularity where human civilization becomes unrecognizable I'm not even convinced that's going to happen now with that being said there are these uh what I call these epocal thresholds where basically like okay yes for for many hundreds of thousands of years humans basically lived as hun gathers and then you know we started to take off and we got you know the uh the Iron Age and the Bronze Age which you know Global phenomenon and then we got to you know the age of Steel and steam and then we got to the Industrial Revolution and so like yes Humanity has gone through many uh epocal changes has crossed many of these thresholds we might be in the midst of the last threshold we might be there might be one or two more thresholds we don't know uh but I'm not really convinced that it's going to be like that drastically different cuz even when in like 1900 someone said you know humans have already invented 90% of everything that is inventable we still live relatively similar to how we did at the turn of the century we go to jobs you know we have factories we have machines uh you know we have a few niftier like machines like we've got iPhones now but that does that hasn't really fundamentally changed how we live okay so this is a graphic that I've had in my head for a while and basically you know like all day in the universe is superset so like if you if if you think about the the universe as an information model there is technically an infinite amount of possible information and data in the universe however a much smaller subset of that is all useful knowledge so there's there's raw data there's information and then there's knowledge and then there's wisdom if you want to you know think about it like that the amount of information that is actually classifiable as useful knowledge is far smaller than the amount of actual data in the universe and then of course all human knowledge is a is a uh subset of useful knowledge but eventually we will get to the point where we have captured all useful knowledge yes like I said there's an infinite amount of information and data in the universe but a lot of that is just noise and so the signal to noise ratio is another thing that I think is following a sigmoid curve and it's kind of already tapering off you know it's like it's not like you sure we understand subatomic particles and gravitons and and higs bosen and you know there's all kinds of tiny fundamental things um and maybe I'm wrong you know we still haven't fully untangled dark matter and dark energy and so maybe there are entire domains of science that are just like out there in The Ether that are completely unknown but at the same time I kind of get the sense that even if it is out there it's it's part of that it's exponent the the Milestones are exponentially getting further and further apart so I don't really see us conquering all that necessarily like in the foreseeable future and even if we do is it going to change Human Society okay so I've rained on everyone's parade what are the implications so the first and biggest question is where is the plateau if indeed scientific and technological progress is following a sigmoid curve which I believe there is plenty of evidence that it is where is the plateau where is it going to taper off and where are we going to end up so again like I said finite amount of knowledge uh useful knowledge in the universe there's also this kind of Di finishing returns or vicious cycle where yes every time we make progress it's great but also the complexity goes up uh in lock step with that and so it's like okay that's what I mean by like every threshold gets further and further apart now this is one thing that I really take issue with is the idea that there is some kind of predictability horizon or Event Horizon Beyond which all all bets are off and and everything changes and suddenly you know life becomes fundament mentally unrecognizable and human civilization changes forever and we all live as goldfish and you know spice tanks or whatever I don't know but I don't really see any evidence of that and like I said I'm like one of the kinds of people that like I would love to have warp drive I would love to have like all kinds of stuff that just might not be possible I remember I had a conversation with a friend of mine uh many years ago good good scientist and I was talking me like when are we going to get faster than light travel and he was like it might just not be possible uh and I address that closer to the end of the video but it like that really stuck with me he's like you know we need to accept the possibility that there are just things that yes we can imagine them as happening but they're just not going to happen jump Gates might not be possible uh you know warp drive might not be possible hyperdrive whatever you want to call it these things like we can imagine them sure but they might forever be within the realm of fantasy all right so I already mentioned aacle thresholds typically we record aacle threshold holds his industrial revolutions the Renaissance was another big one uh you know the Stone Age transition to the uh to the Bronze Age and the Iron Age those could be viewed as uh epocal thresholds the invention of sale in order to circumnavigate the world um these kinds of things the biggest question to me is are we in the last one is the fourth Industrial Revolution the last apocal threshold obviously I'm not going to be so shortsighted as to say we have invented everything that is possible to be invented I remember when I read that quotation like probably I was like 10 or 11 when I read that I'm like wow that dude was an idiot so I'm not going to fall into that trap and say we've invented everything that it is possible to invent no what I am saying though is that even with accelerating technology and science the way that we live is not changing at an accelerated rate if anything the way that we live is changing at a slower rate um so yes can things get better absolutely uh can things still change yes absolutely can we become a multiplanetary species I don't see why not but I'm not saying that it's going to be easy and I think that this is one of the fantasies that people have is that with more and more technological breakthroughs things are just going to get exponentially easier I do think that some things will get easier obviously we would rather live uh today with our technology that we have today than we would like to live 200 years ago because why there's a lot of things that are way easier today but that doesn't mean that life is overall very easy uh so and again the Event Horizon is basically like I whenever people talk about Singularity and whenever I think about Singularity it's like I don't really see this happening if you want to talk about a point of no return I think we crossed that a long time ago uh and we crossed that and it was inevitable not by virtue of the technology or the science but just because the planet is so huge and there's billions of us and you can no more stop research happening in China or Russia or Africa or America or Europe then you can like stop the Earth from spinning why because it's impossible to coordinate 8 billion humans like granted we didn't have 8 billion humans in 1950 we had like 3 billion but the point is is that there is an inexorable process of of of human progress and learning and everything that you just can't stop it so if you want to talk about a point of no return we crossed that a long time ago it's slow it's been a slow buildup but the the aspect of this you know technological Event Horizon and Singularity that I really want to push back on is the magical thinking that seems to emerge where some people say they they just there's this inflation where the it's like okay well someone predicted that you know Human Society civilization might become unrecognizable first I don't see any evidence of that and second that that that is often inflated or conflated with we'll shatter all the laws of physics and anything you can imagine will be possible again like I'm not seeing any evidence of that and in fact I'm seeing evidence to the contrary that even though we have uh exponentially better understanding of the fundamental laws of physics things are changing slower and slower uh and also the reason that I want to push back on this it is it can be a very harmful narrative like it's it it can be as bad as like you know uh narratives of Destruction or utopian narratives or anything where it's like if you imagine that the future will be unimaginably better and happier and safer and and everything and then you ignore the problems today and you stop putting effort today uh well I mean that could that could have negative consequences as well it could result in like learned helplessness or a sense of futility or fertility or just delaying your life like there's a lot to enjoy today okay so those are some of the implications here are some of my specific predictions about what will happen um within the foreseeable future in terms of how it will change how we live so first indefinite lifespan this is one that I think that there's plenty of evidence that it that we are working up to this very quickly I don't know why but but talking about indefinite lifespan seems to trigger some people on the internet not not most but there's a few I always get a couple comments where people are like oh well people have been predicting you know the the Fountain of of Youth for centuries and you're not going to find it and nobody's going to find it and it's like I don't know those people seem to have a Death Wish they're like just stop telling me that I'm going to live forever like that makes me angry I don't I don't understand that reaction um but so there's there's plenty of evidence that we are getting close to this and I remember there was a comment that I got a few weeks ago that someone's like yeah but what about these plaques and proteins and enzymes that accumulate I'm like the fact that you know like what causes aging means that like that's half the battle right there was this famous quotation who was it was it Ray CTSV I think it was Ray CTSV during the Human Genome Project um someone consulted with him and it's like oh well we've only decoded uh 1% of the genome and he's like okay well we're halfway done um that is the nature of exponential progress and that is one place that I agree with him because as an automation engineer if you can automate 1% of the job you can automate 100% of the job why because it's just a matter of like one more step to get something that will finish the process for you and I've had chats with other people in Automation and they agree it's like with Automation and that kind of thing it's like it feels like you achieve nothing till the very end then you hit go and then it's done um but yeah so the combination of of precedents that we see in nature the rapid pace of understanding genetics nanotechnology like man some of the stuff that I've seen just in the last few weeks about nanotech being able to like have programmatic uh like programmable Nano particles that will deliver drugs to specific tissues uh honestly I don't see any any reason any physical reason that we could not within a reasonable time frame relatively soon overcome all of the uh causes of Aging and death at least all the known ones obviously it's entirely possible that the longer you live the more likelihood there will be you know for accidents or unpredictable diseases for instance you know uh 100 years ago there was probably a lot less um uh understanding of things like Alzheimer's and stuff just because people didn't live long enough to have those diseases but I do suspect that indefinite lifespan is coming relatively soon and this this might very well be the biggest single impact to the way that we live it's going to change the way that we relate to ourselves to each other to politics to economics to power it's going to change the way that we do Family Planning it's going to change the the way that we engage with life and fun and Leisure and all that kind of stuff so this I think is going to be the biggest like most fundamental shift in society cybernetic integration I did do a recent video about neuralink I think that neuralink as it is is very uh immature and I don't mean like childish I just mean it's it's an immature technology that being said there is a lot of other research being done with uh impl cybernetic implants of all different kinds not just brain computer interfaces there are uh Rejuvenation uh things such as like bio engineered like semi- living implants that can cure type 1 diabetes I just saw that the other day that's really cool there's also the possibility of like uh there's another implant that I was watching a video about that it like it can regrow your liver so it's like Okay cool so we have lots and lots of of implants and cybernetic integration coming down the pipeline so most of these are focused on um on disease and injury so like you know there's some electrical implants that looks like they can cause your spine to regrow if you've broken your broken your spine and you've been paralyzed that's really cool but there's a really big difference between repairing damage and and enhancements with new capabilities uh and there's also possibly or likely limitations to the level of integration now in fictional places like cyberpunk there's this you know disease called cyber psychosis where basically if you have too many implants you start to go crazy um in Ghost in the Shell there is a cyber cyberbrain sclerosis which is basically like your immune system uh and inflammation responses to implants basically cause your brain to harden and you lose your ability to think uh really horrible possible diseases that could emerge like we could create new diseases with cybernetics so we need to be careful with that now that being said like maybe in the long run there's no reason we can't overcome these things especially if you have forever to figure it all out okay great robotic Workforce I am a huge proponent of what I call post- labor economics and I just think that it makes sense to uh get humans out of the workforce as much as possible uh and I think it's inevitable I think it makes economic sense to replace human labor um I think that there is is no reason that we need jobs so this is another thing that seems to trigger some people I've talked about the existence of leisure classes so uh Greek aristocracy back in the day Roman aristocracy back in the day British aristocracy up through today like there are literally entire civilizations that had classes of people who were not allowed to work so like and they were fine like you don't need work to have a meaningful fulfilling life um Spartan Spartan uh men citizens like they were literally not allowed to have a job you were not allowed to have a profession um if you were a member of a certain crust of society and in fact you can even see this go watch Downtown Abby when what's his name joins and he's like a lawyer it's like oh well that's kind of low brow like why are you still working for money you're one of us now like this still exists today so I don't know why talking about a Leisure Class like triggers some people but it does but I want to point out the fact that like there have been millions and millions of people throughout all of history that did not have a profession and in some cases were legally prohibited from having a profession and they were perfectly happy they had really cool parties um but yeah and so the primary the the primary kpi that I look for as evidence for replacing human labor is better faster cheaper and safer those are the like four criteria that pay attention to that in terms of artificial intelligence and Ai and I still get like comments saying someone like oh well I'd love to see a robot take my job doing tiling it's like you should check on some of the latest uh things that robots are capable of doing um robots are taking really cool form factors they're getting much more dextrous very quickly and then you look at the the the work that I'm doing on the ace framework that Google's doing on RTX and like these these robots are going to be able to do pretty much anything very soon I'm predicting probably this time next year we're going to start to see uh commercial robots that are able to do pretty much any blue collar work uh like mark my words I'll probably do like a prediction Poll for that uh okay so then probably the most extreme thing is going to be transgenic technology we can already do a lot of this uh it's still a very naive technology or an immature technology but the fact that we can even replace organel in cells and then inject that into the into the germ line and what I mean by that is like there are certain diseases that are based on uh defective mitochondria and so what you can do is you can take a healthy mitochondria from another cell and replace your mitochondria with it and then because mitochondria have their own DNA it repl it it it um it reproduces when your cells go through mitosis and so it's like hey you've now created a cell that is a Franken cell uh based on input from multiple organisms uh so between genome editing and epig genomic editing and organel replacement uh like we literally have actual control over the the fundamental levers of biology uh now again like most Technologies and Sciences we are going to find you know maybe some diminishing returns some increasing complexity but there is no physical barrier to like modifying our genes now are we going to all be cat people one day some people might you know if that if that's what they want great it's not what I want um I probably will remain like kind of in this form factor more or less for the foreseeable future now granted you know you live for 10,000 years you might get bored and you want to be a cat person for a while I don't know um but there's also like it's difficult to talk about this stuff without saying like wow but that is intrinsically wrong because we should just be humans forever um but like I don't know that's it's weird also because this is this is super polarizing where some people are like well yeah obviously like if we if we have control over that and we want to change ourselves we should be allowed to do so and then then there are other people that just really cringe at that and they're like no that like is an affront to you know God or whatever like if you change yourself then that's evil or whatever I don't know I remember like so here's the story that I'm thinking of I remember my stepbrother wanted to have jaw surgery to cure his overbite and his religious family like like like got really bent out of shape because it's like well God gave you that jaw and now your your desire to go through cosmetic surgery is an affront to God and it's like okay well I mean that that's them but you know people have an Impulse to control each other anyways I'm getting lost in a in a rabbit hole okay so I did promise that I would address this so This Is We're winding down the video what about aliens so there have been some recent disclosures and it's really difficult to think about like okay if any of the testimony that has been given to Congress which for some background uh was his name David grush and a few others have testified that like yes we have recovered non-human biological entities we have recovered extraterrestrial craft we have documented evidence of these craft that are able to do things that we cannot physically explain um mostly pertaining to acceleration uh and deceleration so it's like okay well how do they accelerate and decelerate that fast um so what is what is the scientific implication of this and one thing I want to say is like okay yes some of these things seem to be magical uh but just because you have a craft that defies the laws a physics as we know it doesn't mean that it is Magic or that it that also doesn't immediately translate to well because that's possible everything else is possible and so I want to leave you with a quote uh any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from Magic this was Arthur C Clark he called it his third law or whatever I guess um but here's an example that I want to leave you with think of your your cell phone your smartphone if you were to tell someone or show someone in the 1500s what a cell phone was and what it could do and the fact that you could literally call someone instantaneously on the other side of the planet um you would have been burned at the stake as a witch because that that technological capacity was just not within the realm of Consciousness until this last century now obviously the I guess the telegraph is over a century old and people started realizing that you could communicate vast different distances instantaneously so maybe a century ago you wouldn't have been burnt at the steak but certainly five centuries ago if you would have said oh yeah here's a magical device that has no physical connections to anything else and I can talk to someone on the other side of the planet you could even talk to people in space if you wanted to they would have literally burned you at at the stake because that is some devilry witchcraft stuff now to a mind 500 years ago your iPhone would have appeared to be pure magic but today we understand that it has very mundane explanations of electrical circuits and radio signals and once you have radio signals and and integrated circuits the rest is pretty much a a given but if you like there was a few comments on recent videos like just imagine trying to explain language models to someone 20 years ago and they would have been like what I don't get it so but today it has a very mundane explanation and so one thing that I want to just kind of really push back on is is just because you can imagine something and just because something seems magical to you today that doesn't mean that it is all that different or all that exotic and it it really comes down to perception and so yes like well Dave like you're saying like Okay so let me just unpack this you know there are things that we can't imagine being possible today that might be possible tomorrow and so like let's reverse that like okay so what is what is the iPhone 500 years from now that we can't possibly imagine today yes that kind of technological leap is possible but it's not necessarily going to be physics shattering uh especially as we learn more and more about science and physics and technology and we get those diminishing returns and I suspect that we're going to have a different orientation towards science and technology eventually and so this is something that kind of I've been thinking about is what happens when we get to a steady state world where it's just kind of a foregone conclusion that like yeah we do know 95% of all science out there and the last 5% is going to be really difficult and expensive to get but like the frontiers of scientific discovery might eventually be known kind of like the age of Discovery when we were sailing around the planet earth eventually all of planet Earth was known now granted there's you know infinite more planets out there to discover so I don't know let me know what you think in the comments like subscribe etc etc thanks for watching I hope this gave you some food for thought cheers
