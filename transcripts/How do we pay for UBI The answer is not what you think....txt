hello everybody David Shapiro here with another video today's video by also popular demand is many are lately is how do we pay for Ubi so I have made a few videos about post-labor economics and you know forever jobs and that sort of stuff I am pretty convinced that most jobs as we know them are going to go away now that's not to say that there's there aren't things that you can do for money in the future you know post Singularity post AGI whatever but you know people are very critical and and rightfully so there are problems with Ubi so let's unpack some of those problems but then let's also look at how we can actually make it financially feasible before we jump in I want to do a quick plug for my patreon uh I give away all of my videos for free no ads I also have uh hundreds of GitHub repos I give all my code away for free uh because I want to help build the future and I believe that lowering friction uh by giving information valuable information away for free is the best way to do that with that being said I have turned down a lot of job offers and contract offers and I refuse to sign ndas but that means that my support needs to come from you people so if you want to incentivize the behavior you want to see sharing uh valuable information please consider jumping over and supporting me on patreon uh all tiers get you access to the exclusive Discord uh so it's it's not something for nothing so yeah thanks for all the support from my existing patreons and with that let's get back to the show uh so right now uh quick other tangent uh Gatto update so I am very excited and pleased to announce that the gato Community has not one but two submissions to the open AI Democratic inputs to AI Grant challenge so this is really incredible uh leaders have emerged in the community and have definitely stepped up so remember Step Up is one of our traditions and the decentralized aspect of gato is taking over basically you don't need my permission to do anything but the community that that I have built that we have built is there to support everyone in whatever initiative makes most sense for them to help achieve uh Global consensus and alignment and to solve the control problem and ultimately create Utopia that is the that is the final the the I don't know about final goal but that's the big goal that's the mission uh now we also have our first hackathon coming up and so this is going to be layer one of gato reinforcement learning with heuristic imperatives uh I've been having meetings with people I've been talking with folks uh it's slowly coming together I've never put on a hackathon before uh so I'm talking to people the but if you're interested in participating or want to share any insight the best place to connect with me is either on LinkedIn or join the gato Community the link is here um go to framework.org join gotta you can also find the link in the description we need sponsors organizers judges Partners mentors that's going to be a big one team leaders um so this is coming together we're hoping to launch it sometime in July but again this is my first rodeo so I'm trying to learn everything I can up front all right now let's get back to Ubi how do we pay for it I used to think that this was just kind of a thought-stopping platitude uh but when I looked into it I I really tried hard to figure out okay how can we pay for it with conventional means and the answer is not quite what I expected and maybe it's not what you expected all right so here's the problem uh as uh you can easily do some math in a previous video where I talked about life under Ubi I said let's figure out how you can actually live with two thousand dollars a month people I think accept the premise of like if you can get just two thousand dollars a month just for existing great we can make that work some people are unhappy with some of the ideas but you know what it's not perfect and also I don't have a crystal ball I can't tell you how it's going to work out exactly that being said two thousand dollars a month in America with 330 million Americans is somewhere between seven trillion and eight trillion dollars per year to fund a Ubi so how do you do this do you tax and redistribute uh taxes would have to be insanely High to support this uh not to mention the inflation inflationary problem but I'm not as worried about inflation because if Ubi becomes necessary the job loss is going to be super deflationary and as lots of people point out uh if consumers have no money to spend then you know the economy basically stalls so basically Ubi might be necessary in order to just keep the economy going but that being said it's not as simple as just tax and redistribute I thought that it would be so there's a concept called velocity of currency which is basically how often does a dollar change hands and the velocity of currency I think would have to be three times higher than what it is now just in order to have enough transactions uh to to to even tax to get to that two thousand dollars a month so you you could either do that or you could tax levy more taxes on static money like any bank account over ten thousand dollars or whatever but this is getting really really Draconian really quickly you'd have to force enforce a lot more circulation um and so then I was like okay I keep going down this rabbit hole and it's just not working it doesn't make sense um so I was like maybe we're putting the cart before the horse maybe maybe we need to look at something else before we look at Ubi to make Ubi sustainable and feasible and so then I was like okay well money is is an abstraction of value it's a it's a reserve of value and it's a medium of exchange but let's look at the underpinning assets what is the actual value in goods and services that money is meant to buy for you so that's where I went next but before we get into that I want to kind of give a little bit of context about the economic pillars and how I kind of came to this conclusion that just raw redistribution in our current economic uh Paradigm isn't going to work so basically there are four pillars of the economy you've got Banks namely central banks and Regional Banks and federal banks that you have the government particularly the federal government you have businesses and corporations and then you have consumers so these are the primary Estates or pillars of the economy and so consumers is the aggregate you know all individuals and households that need goods and services and generally also sometimes provide work usually the way that they get income is in exchange for labor sometimes there's also entitlements or uh or Capital that they own so those are the three primary ways that consumers get money right an entitlement might come from the government such as your your pension or your uh your your social security check uh that sort of thing so you get money that way Medicare Medicaid uh you know the the government Health uh you know through the VA that gives you buying power which means that you can then go to a business uh such as a health care provider or grocery store or whatever to demand goods and services such as health care food education is an entitlement so that is something that you don't even pay for the government just pays for it directly via taxes uh and then but then one thing that a lot of people don't know is where does the money come from well what you need to understand about the monetary system is that the money comes from central banks comes from the federal bank which uh creates money by lending it but the thing is is that that money then has to be repaid and so that's whenever you hear in the news like the FED is changing the interest rate that's what it that's what they're doing is they're changing the fundamental interest rate and when that money is repaid to the central banks it's actually just taken off the market entirely with that being said the total supply of money goes up over time it like def there is it there is an optimal amount of inflation that uh that they go for because the idea is that if the value of your dollar goes down over time then you are incentivized to spend it sooner rather than later which keeps the economy churning because under deflationary pressures you might as well hold on to your money because holding on to cash is an investment if your dollar will go twice as far a year from now as it does today you're not going to spend any money you're going to wait so having an optimal amount of inflation is what the central banks do to ensure that you are going to spend that money on labor and other Investments to keep the economy humming along so with that being said you can't just inject a lot of money like you know the idea of like what if you do quantitative easing which is just creating billions or trillions of dollars and give it to Consumers that's called hyperinflation and that is super bad and I think I'm actually supposed to be oh yeah sorry so the if uh sorry I meant to move on to a slide so if you do just quantitative easing just injecting money into the system that's hyperinflation which means that you severely depress the value of money which means that like okay the money that you have today is going to be worth a lot less tomorrow and so uh inflation can be caused by two primary things supply and demand so Supply is what we're experiencing uh post pandemic because of logistic and supply chain issues because of supply chain issues uh the supply of goods is lower which means the prices go up alternatively if the demand goes up the prices can also go up and that's what we saw a little bit the effect wasn't too pronounced but it was pronounced enough to be meaningful with the stimulus checks that Americans got during the pandemic which caused some inflation it didn't cause most of the inflation that we're seeing most the inflation that we're seeing is due to uh geopolitics and globalism and global trade uh you know namely like the war in Russia and Ukraine right now that is a far larger impact on inflation than uh the stimulus checks that being said if we were to do stimulus checks for everyone every month we would absolutely see hyperinflation which is really bad because all you're doing is injecting money um into the consumer part and then okay that money goes where it goes to businesses and so then the businesses have more aggregate demand but then how do you take that money back off of the table so that you uh you you basically fight it with deflation you'd have to have someone just hoovering up that extra money and destroying it so does that mean the government just then taxes everyone to to take that quantitative easing back off of the economy we might get there especially once we get to a period of hyper abundance and where like nobody works and labor like human labor is completely uh worthless but I don't I don't see that we're there yet and I and I think that such a fundamental paradigm shift in economics probably shouldn't be done all at once we should probably work towards that slowly because again the economic system is huge cumbersome there's a tremendous amount of inertia and so I was like okay clearly like thinking about it in terms of current velocity of currency and circulation and Cycles uh like a hydrological cycle it that's how it works now but we can't fundamentally change this we can't upend it uh very quickly so I was like all right this direction of thinking isn't working so let's look at first principles so supply and demand so what I mean is if you can get a hyperabundance of Supply right post scarcity then the price goes down and so then I was like okay well if we really really drastically increase supply of basic Goods basic Services then maybe we can get the prices low enough that Ubi is actually really cheap overall and so what I mean by that is what if we can get your cost of living from four thousand dollars a month to four hundred dollars a month as it is today through hyperabundance through post scarcity and we can get there through things like uh AI solar Quantum Computing and that sort of thing so let's unpack this a little bit further and figure out how we can make that happen let's take a look at the at consumer expenses so this is as of 2016. so it's a little bit out of date but in general this pie chart doesn't change we generally spend about a third of our money on housing another 16 on Transportation almost 13 on food 12 on insurance and uh paying into pensions uh or retirement plans eight percent on health care so on and so forth and then down to 2.5 percent on education obviously the education number is much larger for some people uh I've I've known people that that spent more on their uh their college loans than their home loans which is just completely insane to me but we took we take a look at these top five categories right one two three four five and if we can use the hyperabundance of solar infusion and whatever else uh wind energy and then we can also use the hyperabundance of cognitive labor from AI we could probably reduce costs of a lot of these sectors now these sectors are very very different but I did find some commonalities that I think we can focus on so first is transportation obviously Elon Musk and Tesla and full self-driving cars and all the EVS coming onto the road this is going to have an economic effect but it one thing is that transportation is Central to the economy because you need transportation to move good services and people um or to move goods and people uh and then you can provide services such as ride shares delivery that sort of thing so right now internal combustion engine cars cost about 75 cents per Rider mile this varies a lot depending on the car you have and where you are uh because obviously if you're driving you know an F-350 Dually that costs a little bit more to drive per mile than you know Toyota Prius but on average internal combustion engine cars cost about 70 cents per Rider mile now what's interesting is that in America because of regulatory problems and technical issues and supply chain issues EVS are often more expensive per Rider mile the total cost of ownership of EVS is actually still higher than internal combustion engines now that being said Eevee ride sharing such as if you don't own the car but instead you just you know use Uber or Lyft or Waze or whatever and then you know a couple minutes later an autonomous car comes to pick you up the the the the cost of that Rider mile could be as low as six cents per Rider mile so we're seeing we see the possibility of like a 12x reduction or more of the cost of Transportation uh if we can figure out full self-driving and fully autonomous uh EV uh vehicles and some of this will be fixed by economies of scale but that being said uh the if you can reduce the cost of Transportation by a factor of 10 or more this is going to have knock-on effects across the rest of the economy and so we'll unpack this effect uh throughout the rest of the video so here's some of the knock-on effects that we might see just I want to prime your primary your mind to think about the knock-on effects oh and also just imagine the knock-on effects of reducing the cost of energy by 10x with solar with fusion and of course with Fusion the cost of energy goes down a thousand X it goes down 10 000 x to the point that it is a trivial cost so the idea is that uh well first think all Goods that you need right every clothing every piece of clothing all the food you eat all the materials that go into your house literally every physical good has to be transported at least a short distance many of them have to be transported across the entire planet so if we can get the cost of transportation to a fraction of what it is today that will lower the cost of living drastically because then you know the supply chain is faster more efficient cheaper we can also use artificial intelligence to shorten those Supply chains Quantum Computing can probably help with Logistics as well energy hyperabundance will also help with that because that means that you can have fully automated factories in the next city over and your stuff doesn't have to come from across the planet you can have vertical farms and container Farms meaning that all of your food and exotic fruit and everything is grown right next door you year round with the energy abundance of solar and wind and that sort of stuff uh economies of scale artificial intelligence can help us find alternative Battery Technology so for instance there's what is it the iron oxygen batteries that are being worked on and other stuff that doesn't use risky uh minerals now I know that lithium is hypothetically super abundant but you know looking at the elemental composition of the crust of the earth is one thing looking at the mining infrastructure and the concentration uh that makes it economically feasible to extract is an entirely other argument but anyways moving stuff around the planet is very expensive and it is a very complicated thing so the combination of Transport Revolution along with energy hyperabundance is going to really drastically drop that so this is going to have knock-on effects that's going to lower the cost of everything like just full stop it's going to lower the cost of everything across the planet housing so the biggest uh expense that we all have is housing so let's assume that okay moving Timber harvesting wood making concrete all of these things that are very very uh material intensive you have to move a lot of heavy materials and they're also very energy intensive carbon uh sorry concrete accounts just on its own concrete accounts for I think more than eight percent of global carbon emissions so like this is a very energy intensive and very material intensive thing which is why houses are so expensive there's also the labor aspect it takes a lot of Labor and expertise to build a house so what if we can really drastically reduce the cost of building homes whether it's a single family home or a duplex or a small apartment or row houses whatever uh there's a few ways that we can approach this but again remember Transportation has already lowered the cost a lot uh things like 3D printed houses I watched an entire documentary to do research and 3D printed houses are more durable um so they're also cheaper their upfront cost is much cheaper because it takes a lot less labor to build them uh so you you with with robotic automation you get as many humans out of it as possible which makes it faster and cheaper the end product is better too so better cheaper faster this is what Ai and automation does better cheaper faster you combine the existing innovation of 3D printing with energy hyper abundance and then you add even more Ai and Automation and then suddenly you can just 3D print houses a thousand a day if you need to uh now one problem is that this requires regulatory overhaul uh this is a very new discipline and so a lot of Manufacturers aren't even touching this thing uh with that being said I suspect we're going to see a ramp up because some of the big housing uh manufacturers the ones that make uh gigantic subdivisions like Lamar they're already experimenting with this and investing in it um and so when the investment is there you know that it's coming fast and I was actually surprised to learn that there are entire subdivisions Across America that have already been 3D printed and I really wish that they were here in the South because I super want a 3D printed house can you imagine having a castle made of concrete that it's 3D printed and extruded I super want that super bad but I don't think that there's anyone doing it here in the South we'll see so how much is this going to actually reduce the cost of homes ice found evidence that some small 3D printed homes could be as low as four thousand dollars um generally they're closer to ten thousand dollars uh for a small one and of course one thing that a lot of people complained about when I mentioned like moving into tiny houses and you know portable houses and stuff like that is people like I don't want to live in a closet like it's not a closet it's just a small house anyways icon is a company that exists today and is printing 2 000 square foot houses for a hundred thousand dollars so my house that I live in now is eighteen hundred square feet on an acre of land and I paid 200 000 for it ten years ago so I could have something a little bit bigger for half that price and of course my house is worth like four hundred thousand now uh because of you know inflation and stuff so these these commercial uh buildings are much cheaper already so if they're you know twice as cheap or ha or sorry half as cheap or or a fifth as as expensive as it costs to build uh stick Built Homes then we're already on the way to that like let's let's collapse the price of housing now you combine uh solar AI uh wind eventually Fusion concrete gets much cheaper uh you can you can also factory farm wood more you can automate uh Timber forests um and so then let's let's say that we're we're working towards dropping the uh cost of housing by at least 10x so instead of 33 or 35 of your daily or your monthly income it costs three and a half percent so my twelve hundred dollar mortgage would go down to 120 which is pretty sustainable that's just a couple days worth of work for for many people uh and it's less than an hour of work for a lot of uh professionals that being said we're looking at you know Ubi which is nobody works but if you can Mass produce homes then like hey great now also with Ubi because one thing that people have pointed out is that uh land is expensive desirable land will always be expensive but America is really really empty sorry I have that in a future slide there is lots and lots of land to expand into so land is actually going to be relatively cheap the hardest part is going to be water but we can fix that with solar because then you can distill and recycle any amount of water in the long run I think that I think the compounding returns of robotic automation artificial intelligence and energy hyper abundance means that we could eventually see a 100x drop in the cost of housing meaning that a five hundred thousand dollar house in today's money would cost you five thousand dollars in 10 to 20 years now food and other Goods so what I realized is that okay Transportation great you solved that problem you've basically solved a lot of other problems that have again those knock-on effects you fix Transportation you make it super cheap that makes housing cheaper uh you get compounding returns there because all the lessons that you learn from robotic automation for delivery and and that sort of stuff that makes that makes that cheaper but those lessons also apply directly to agriculture as well as a bunch of other things now one thing that I thought was that okay if these industries get so cheap that they're not sustainable because what happens is the margins narrow and so when you have no profit that can be made you have to either become a non-profit organization and and uh you basically survive on uh subsidies or donations or you can be nationalized by the by the by the government which means that the government then runs things but uh the Soviets tried to nationalize Agriculture and it caused mass famines that killed like millions and millions and millions of people um so we should not we should probably never nationalize agriculture at least not for a long time until it is so thoroughly operationalized that there is no chance for accidentally causing Mass famine through Central management so I am personally in the favor of keeping private corporations but then subsidizing their existence which we already do by by the way we subsidize corn and a few other uh Mass crops just so that way we can ensure that it keeps growing so we're already doing that so if we also subsidize other things like home building so that no matter how cheap it actually gets the corporations can keep building them and then the government gives them just a little bit of money to ensure that they remain afloat uh another possibility is changing ownership models which I talked about in other videos so by by creating locally owned decentralized autonomous organizations you could probably incorporate uh the land you know the the municipally owned land and then it can be owned operated and managed by the citizens of that city or county so that is an ownership model that also makes sense because then there's no profit motive it's basically we're going to work this land to feed our local community and if we do have any excess we can then sell it to neighboring communities or whatever local sourcing circular economies that sort of stuff AI energy hyper abundance and robotic automation will all make this a lot more feasible and in fact again if those prices collapse it'll be necessary to do that because then you're providing a good or a service not for profit but just because it's needed um so you know the best the best good is the one that's basically free or it kind of woven into the fabric of your community automated forestry as I mentioned Timber is one of the most useful resources out there first uh creating uh felling trees and creating lumber from it is a carbon sink uh actually Building Homes out of wood permanently sequestered or semi-permanently sequesters that into uh into um into the the structure of the house concrete even though it's very energy intensive to create now uh is also going to be a carbon sink or a potential carbon sink depending on the additives that you add to it and so then you have a permanent carbon sink so automating forestry automating uh the the production of concrete these things can be probably used to one help fight climate change because it's like okay there's a x amount of carbon in the atmosphere let's pull that carbon out put it into into trees and then we can use that to uh then build homes and so my idea here is you co-locate automated forests with a modular home Factory and then you deliver those modular uh house components with fully automated self-driving semi trucks and then the final assembly and site prep is done with robots and so you have this end to end uh new supply chain that is 100 sustainable uh there's just a few things that we need there energy abundance uh better robots a little bit better Ai and full self-driving cars but the economic incentive is there for all of that to happen so this these these virtuous Cycles these compounding returns I think will allow us to drastically drop the prices of our most expensive asset which is our homes all right so let's do a quick price check if just for ballpark figures for something that's kind of more reasonable in the short term let's imagine that within five to ten years we can uh and it probably will take longer than that honestly just because of uh inertia but we drop our housing cost by 10x we drop our food cost by 10x and we drop our transportation by 10x so basically your your basic living expenses for me go from twenty one hundred and fifty dollars a month to 250 a month your dollar can go a lot farther with technology so that leaves Health Care insurance and a few other uh big expenses like clothing and you know fun and entertainment and that sort of stuff but Healthcare is one of the biggest ones that's remaining education is also expensive but I I actually didn't even feel like I needed to address education especially for the younger people who are all you already using chat GPT to learn everything um and that's only going to get better by the way uh you're going to have ai and robotic tutors and teachers and stuff that are going to be uh infinitely patient fully personalized so I actually had a really good conversation with someone who wants to deploy AI to Africa um to basically say we're going to take Africa uh as an entire continent straight into the 21st century by providing personalized education for literally every child in Africa so I'm really excited to be helping out with that project but the idea is that AI can do that so and it's also going to be cheap so that's why I didn't I guess I did just address education but anyway ways let's break down health care because Healthcare is like the gigantic elephant in the room particularly here in America but it's also a contentious issue in places with socialized medicine such as Britain and France there's long waiting lists um and then of course the their private uh care is available but like what was I reading like dental care in Britain is actually kind of difficult because dentists are required to take a certain number of you know like they have a quota of uh of you know government provided ones but they will prefer to do uh you know to do uh private uh funded like right off the bat so like if you're on a waiting list if you have money and pay for it out of pocket you can get care immediately so there are problems with the idea of socialized medicine so the idea is let's drive down the cost of socialized medicine as much as possible uh to to basically uh avoid avoid the cost so there's an age-old adage an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure so let's focus on lowering health care costs primarily with prevention um obviously we Americans were pretty unhealthy some of it is lifestyle some of his diet choices but a lot of it is just age-related diseases we are living longer which means that uh really dangerous and expensive diseases like heart disease and cancer are killing us instead of accidents and treatable infections so therefore the focus should be on healthy aging such as with regenerative medicines they can get you back to full health and then Rejuvenation therapies that can actively lower your age and there's been a lot of breakthroughs uh just in the last few weeks where AI has helped us identify uh chemical substances enzymes many of them naturally occurring in in nature they can actually literally de-age your cells so basically the the cheapest doctor the best doctor is the one that you never need and then if we can replace the rest with robots and Ai and that kind of thing then like you know the cost of Health Care just collapses because you know I remember I was uh a couple years ago before the pandemic I was visiting a bar with a friend and the bartender she was a little bit younger she was in her 20s and she was like why would I have health insurance I am healthy and I'm like just wait till your 30s or 40s but the idea is that you know and this was actually one of the biggest problems with Obamacare here in America was that young people didn't sign up because young people didn't care because young people are healthy right most of our health costs are age-related so what I suspect in the future is that most Healthcare is going to be so take those self-driving cars in your robotic doctor you call and just like hey I need a checkup or hey I'm feeling sick and then you know like an automated uh card pulls up and a robot doctor comes out and you know says okay what's wrong you know Ted does a couple of tests and then you know treats you on the spot and then away they go so you can even get rid of most Hospitals now that being said you're still going to need Trauma Centers for like accidents and uh there will probably still will be some major diseases uh things that require icus and that sort of stuff but if we can drastically reduce the need even just a baseline need for edu not education for healthcare then that's a great way to avoid the cost because the thing is is if you are healthy that is cheap so this is this is an expense that we can just hypothetically fully get rid of so I call this Healthcare avoidance um you know AI is going to be the primary thing here with personalized genetic medicine stem cell therapy de-aging Rejuvenation that sort of stuff one thing is that a lot of people are like oh the elites are never going to allow the rest of us to have um no the thing is is that healthy consumers are good consumers dead consumers don't spend any money right so yes the insurance companies and you know the the big Pharma and stuff they want to keep you sick but the thing is is that's not good for the economy because if you have to spend you know eight percent or 16 or for people that with dealing with chronic conditions up to half of their money on on just Health it would be way better for the economy the government for Society for literally everyone else except for the people who profiteer off of uh uh chronic illnesses it would be better for literally everyone else to just get rid of those health issues altogether um being healthy is cheap cheap citizens keep paying taxes uh they keep working uh cheap or healthy consumers keep buying goods and services and they buy goods and services other than health care so the economic incentive is there so whenever people complain about like oh well the elites are going to keep it for themselves I don't think that's going to be the case and one thing another reason that I believe this is because when you look at what it actually takes to create regenerative medicine uh autologous stem cells and Rejuvenation therapies these are not particularly expensive yeah I know there's that that Tech bro out in California who's spending a million dollars a year to like quote get back to age 18 um you know but the thing is is like a lot of these uh yes that that is expensive but when you look at what's actually effective and the the underlying principles it's not that expensive and all we need to do is like figure out how to mass produce some of these things and the economics it makes sense this is another thing where I think government subsidies will make sense as well because if you cure something permanently if the treatment is not that expensive hypothetically but you still need someone to do it I I think that the pharmac and doctors and everyone else will probably be incentivized through subsidies like basically here's how I might structure that incentive uh structure where let's say let's say someone comes to you and they've got a chronic condition what you would do is actually incentivize the doctor to cure that chronic condition by saying if you cure this permanently you get a twenty thousand dollar bonus for curing it permanently so basically you incentivize the behavior that you want to see if it's like heart disease like oh hey like you've got high cholesterol you've you're starting to get heart failure let's give you the right medicines the right therapies the right treatments to permanently cure this to clear all your arteries to make sure that your health that your heart is as healthy as it was when you were eight years old right then you incentivize that you incentivize The Cure not the treatment because that's one of the biggest problems with medicine today is through government subsidies and Medicare and Medicaid and all that stuff we incentivize the treatment which is why doctors over diagnose but what we really need to do is incentivize the cures okay now one thing that I need to address and I have addressed this in previous videos is that even if we create hyperabundance of energy and Timber and uh and cognitive labor there's still going to be a few primary scarce inputs to the economy namely desirable land and Rare Minerals so to address both of these desirable land uh as I mentioned America is super super empty uh there is a lot of place that we can spread to and if your job is not tight at one if you don't have a job you can live anywhere you want but also if your job is not tied to a geographic location a particular City you can also move wherever you want remote work is on the rise so there is a lot of space that we can spread out into and before you say oh well there's a reason people don't live there that's not necessarily true a lot of the frontier towns were built by the railroad companies who just said hey we're going to build a railroad through this area they bought all the land they built it they literally just fabricated a town which is why you see some of them in straight lines right through like Arkansas and Nebraska and stuff is because they were literally just fabricated out of the Great Plains where the railroads created a train station and then sold the land and developed it and said look now there's a town here I think we're going to see the same thing again not necessarily through railroads but point my point is that you can create a town pretty much anywhere in America now one the biggest problem is water is actually the scarcest resource but with energy hyperabundance you can recycle water pretty easily so yeah if you want to live out in New Mexico you might live A little bit more like the fremen which some people wouldn't want to do that anyways Rare Minerals is going to be the other big thing but I don't know if you saw in the news NASA and a few others are working on sending probes uh to like uh asteroids and meteors uh that are chock full of really really valuable minerals so hopefully we can end up with a hyperabundance of minerals just by mining asteroids in space if we can't do that the coming age of quantum Computing is going to help us create what's called meta materials so these are like nanoparticles that give us properties that you wouldn't otherwise expect so one of the most famous one of course is like carbon nanotubes and um and graphene right graphene is a single sheet of carbon which has really really cool properties it can be uh it can be um superconductive it can be a super super fast transistor that sort of stuff So Meta materials and Material Science will be accelerated by artificial intelligence and Quantum Computing so hopefully we can just say you know what instead of you know needing Cobalt and and nickel and cadmium and lithium what if we can just make everything out of iron and carbon with met with nanoparticles that are really cheap to mass produce we're not there yet but hypothetically it's possible so we could overcome these two major scarce bottlenecks so I mentioned Quantum Computing I found this interesting quotation from an article by the US Department of energy Quantum Computing enables unprecedented Material Science simulations so basically uh as Quantum Computing ramps up and I just posted an article IBM there are 127 qubit quantum computer is actually doing real work now so Quantum the age of quantum Computing is ramping up that'll help us solve stuff like fusion and everything else to do with energy make better solar panels cheaper solar panels genetics and diseases very complex interactions and discovering new drugs and and that sort of stuff Quantum Computing can help with that artificial intelligence can already help with that but you can get a much better faster simulation one of the most interesting things about Quantum Computing is because it basically magically solves optimization problems we have a really hard time verifying the results so basically you run the simulation and then you'll have to test it in reality to see if the simulation was accurate but they're establishing benchmarks about how to gauge the accuracy of a Quantum simulation this Material Science will also accelerate our understanding of batteries metals and other meta materials as I mentioned solar solar is going to be one of the big things on top of everything else that helps with uh driving down the costs um I've seen a lot of people mention computronium um in the comments which okay yes I know Isaac Arthur loves talking about things like computronium and other stuff but this is already happening someone asked me and I'm like neuromorphic chips exist like so a neuromorphic chip is basically an analog chip that in some cases just uses Ambient Energy to do computation it's a real thing but you can't just magically transmute matter into computational material you have to create a meta material which is very difficult right now and know the entire light cone will not be transmuted into computronium that is Pure Fantasy I think um now that being said yes I do believe that the universe is itself a computer so technically all matter is already computronium it's just not Computing something that you deliberately want it to because of the laws of entropy and that sort of stuff anyways getting lost in a tangent Quantum Computing is on the is on the ascendancy and so you have Quantum Computing artificial intelligence and energy hyperabundance all coming together that are going to continue to drive down the cost of literally everything so this is the Snowball Effect uh AI is already accelerating science and lots of other stuff for that matter um I I think actually one of the future hackathons that I'm going to put on is let's automate science as much as possible uh you you have this compounding return where AI helps you do science faster it helps you research AI faster it helps you create more energy abundance faster which all feeds back into the system accelerating the AI which then accelerates Material Science what you know so you get this virtuous cycle this Snowball Effect where suddenly all problems seem to be solvable faster and faster so this is the Triple Crown uh artificial intelligence Quantum Computing oh and Quantum Computing I think I forgot to mention this is that Quantum Computing will also help us design better chips and the materials that go into those better chips so then the quantum computers can help design better quantum computers and better gpus and better tpus which then allows us for better AI which can then improve through Quantum Computing infusion and so you have this three-way interaction this Trifecta of these three technologies that are going to just completely spiral and so those are the three technologies that will lead to hard takeoff these are the three technologies that will lead to the singularity is artificial it's not just artificial intelligence it's artificial intelligence Quantum Computing and um and energy hyperabundance AKA solar wind Fusion that sort of stuff the tldr is that all material concerns basically go away they become so cheap that the cost is trivial that I I suspect you'll they'll have to just subsidize those with government subsidies and so Universal basic income is basically going to be paid for by virtue of we're going to destroy the cost of living so butterfly effect as I've talked about there's all these kinds of interactions and compounding returns and virtuous Cycles this is why I give all my code away for free so I mentioned this at the beginning of the video with my patreon I refuse to sign any ndas because any problem that I solve that has the ability to accelerate this future cannot be locked up as intellectual property and honestly with the way that AI is going I think intellectual property is probably also going the way of the dinosaurs because if AI is generating all intellectual property who cares um the economic productivity that we're going to see in the next couple of years yes it's going to be impressive yes we're going to have quadrillion dollar companies but that all absolutely pales in comparison to what's coming decades after that like when we have the possibility of curing literally every disease imaginable and live long enough to see the stars to see the future what does money matter like what does the economics matter so basically solve solve all these other problems and money becomes irrelevant so this is the underpinning reason for all of my work and the axiomatic alignment the heuristic imperatives that I've been working on which is why I want to equip AI with these things because you reduce suffering by treating diseases you reduce suffering by uh increasing Justice by protecting individual liberty and human rights you increase Prosperity by accelerating science by deploying infrastructure by protecting ecosystems you increase understanding by communication by education by teaching by reinforcing that that virtuous cycle of Science and com and computation and artificial intelligence all of these things work together in compounding returns in order to create the future that we want to see AKA Utopia which I know Utopia is a is a loaded term but to me Utopia means high standard of living High individual liberty and high social Mobility that's the goal alright thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this cheers
