all right hey everybody David Shapiro here with a very special podcast interview today we're uh speaking with Mike tadasco a super interesting guy I think this is probably the third or fourth time I've talked with you Mike um and just every time I do it's like I feel so good about like everything that I'm doing and everything that everyone is working on and so I just wanted to uh wanted to share that excitement with the world so thank you so much for being here we end up talking for an hour every time and it's like so like engaging so I just wanted to like reproduce that and share it with the world um so Mike is uh like I said super interesting guy um would you mind uh just telling the audience just a little bit about kind of where you come from and what you've done uh just kind of get us prime the pump so to speak sure yeah no thanks David um look I'm you know my 60 seconds I I was born and and raised in the suburbs of Chicago kind of grew up uh as a child in the 80s collecting comic books and sports cards and things like that and uh eventually put my way through college doing that uh when I left college and entered the real world I started off as an accountant and I was probably the world world's worst accountant in many ways moved on to the very sexy industry known as paper manufacturing um so literally and this was right at the time of like the office so I couldn't tell you the amount of like under Mifflin jokes I heard over time um but uh I learned a lot of like interesting things in a in a very old arcade industry and and just had tons of insights from there I actually love to get an MBA um started a e-commerce company after that uh on selling original artwork called sketch Maven and after doing that for a few years join PayPal and I was at PayPal for 10 and a half years before leaving recently uh doing a lot of things in product and for the last five running their innovation.org excellent yeah I mean such such a fascinating background and and so many people uh come come to you know technology and today AI from just such a diverse background I want to pick your brain about like what was it what was it like being the the world's worst accountant and then switching to paper and then switching to like what was what was that what was that choice because I mean obviously like going back and getting an MBA like it sounds like you might have just realized like man I took I took a wrong turn I need to backtrack is that is that kind of what happened yeah I mean look part of it I mean specifically on the the MBA was we had I was living in Ohio when I got out of school and and that's where I met my wife and we had an opportunity to move out to California which was awesome and so when we moved out here it was for her job I continued to work for my company I was working remotes uh for my company back in Ohio and frankly I didn't know anybody out here and going back to school and getting an MBA was frankly my way to meet people um I was able to do it through my employers I was doing it part time while I was there but it was just a way to meet people and network and all of that wonderful stuff um as part of the process I'll pause there because I think David died hey there there you go yeah I finished my sentence but then I was like oh is this gonna I think it's still recording through all of it so I closed the wrong tab I apologize I was trying to reduce distractions and then I reduce all the distractions to zero so no it should it should still be recording and if not we'll clean it up in the no it seemed to record through the whole thing and like I said I kind of just finished the thought on um um coming out and doing my MBA to meet people excellent excellent yeah so so you used it to to meet people to to get ahead to stand out in the crowd and clearly it worked you know you were able to do a a a a e-commerce platform sketch Maven and then eventually to PayPal but you said that there was a some interesting things that you learned at sketch Maven so what are some stories from from your uh your first e-commerce Venture yeah so sketch Maven was something look I recommend this for everybody like just have an ideologue that you keep I've been doing this since I was at least an undergrad I'm 45 now so like this is a long time I've been just kind of keeping a list of the ideas that I have and ideas for whatever because like you never want a good idea or a bad idea of go to waste and every good idea starts as a bad idea and I just remember one time as a kid I went to Comic in in baseball card and sports card conventions selling stuff and I'd be a dealer and so forth and I remember going to this one convention uh boy early 90s or something and seeing an artist there and the artist had a cover of a um of a Green Lantern comic book that I really liked and to give you a background on this so at least back in the day before things went digital um every comic book you have ever seen in your life came from a hand-drawn piece of artwork and even though that comic book has may have been viewed by millions of people multiple times there's only one original from which that came and so it creates this really unique problem where for every comic book piece of artwork that has ever existed there's one and only one of them but there are millions and tens of millions of these pages and covers and so forth of that so it's a very unique problem um in that space and when I was a kid and saw this this cover I was like oh um you know it was 150 bucks I think it was I'm like I didn't quite have that money I had some decent money I was selling a lot of stuff but I didn't have 150 bucks to blow on a piece of artwork you know when I'm like 13 years old or something especially back in the 90s so when I was fast forward I'm an accountant so I'm actually making real money out there in the workforce and so probably I was like it just dawned me I'm like wow I should go buy that thing go on eBay can't find it go on all these other places you can't find it I don't know where this thing is I don't know where it is and that's the reality when there's only one of something in the world it's really hard to find where that thing is and when there's like I said millions of these ones well then like that's sort of an interesting problem and that's what birthed the concept for sketch may even it was a very structured marketplace where people could buy and sell and even say that they want and desire certain pieces of original comic book art I started the business in 2009 and you know and it was a Marketplace like because most of these things were being sold on eBay at the time and I think even today in very many ways they still are some artists have their own sites and so forth but there was nowhere to find it if I wanted to tell the world I wanted this Green Lantern cover there was no way to actually do so um and honest and so this was an idea I had 10 years prior 2009 I'm going through my idea file and I'm like oh that's interesting I wonder if anyone's done that lo and behold knots and I'm like well maybe this is something that I should build I don't really care about the Green Lantern cover anymore to be completely honest but but uh the concept's still held true and I felt that if this could work for a niche that I understood like original comic art well it could definitely work for other things um like pens and collectible shoes and sneakers and things like that um where I felt that they were vastly underserved by eBay and other sites at the time and you know in some ways that thesis proved out you know there's goats and stockx and so forth that now do damn shoes it's probably about five years too early as those launched uh you know much later um but you know as I was building the site it was my first experience ever building something I was on upwork which was known at oh as odesk at the time I was hiring people everything from PR people to engineers and so forth I was just figuring out stuff myself um this was even before like Braintree and stripe mind you so I remember like having Engineers work and help build the sites and and a few days before launch and I look and I'm going through the checkout myself and you know I'm like there's no little lock icon in the for the shopping cart when people are entering their credit card information and again this is like stripe took care of that like you don't even need to worry about that anymore 2009 uh that was a problem and I'm like oh God I didn't write that in the spec document for the engineers to actually say yes this needs to be secure and so on and so forth um and so is all of these fun things so it was an amazing two-year ride that had to deal you know happy customers unhappy customers hackers all this wonderful stuff uh that I learned about in my in my two years there excellent yeah I mean so it I mean there's so much there's so much to unpack there because like you know you had an idea file you came back to it after 10 years right and that probably especially for some of the younger audience members who are just getting into you know just cutting their teeth on AI and startups and stuff just the idea of you know you jot all this stuff down do you have any like let's start there like do you have any pro tips on you know keeping ideas you said all good ideas start as bad ideas and in this case there was something that you wanted right that was kind of the Genesis of this but then like then we'll unpack some of the Lessons Learned but let's start let's start there with the the ideas the brainstorming how did how did you decide that like this was something you were going to build oh how do I decided something I was going to build um because it intrigued me I I mean again I remember this I remember you know being a kid and seeing this and then I remember writing it down you know 10 years later and then 10 years of give or take after that going back and saying oh I'm sure somebody has already done that like like that was my gut reaction I'm like oh I'm sure this exists this is a no-brainer this has to exist in the world doing a little bit of research and be like huh it doesn't and again mind you just because something already exists in the world doesn't mean that you shouldn't do your own version of it so I want to be really really clear um you know Google was the 30th 40th major search engine that launched um it was in plenty of people said like why does the world need another search engine they just you know using page Rank and other things they just had a better and more Innovative way of doing things so just because something exists doesn't mean you shouldn't um but to me that was just a really interesting tell in in a way of just saying oh this is something I like this is something I'm passionate about um I want to go through this ride and you know the I I should just go along and do more analysis and I remember then going to conventions talking to artists talking to collectors just talking to people like hey how are you how are you buying stuff and new people were using eBay I knew people were using like a site called comic art fans and and others and just doing the research seeing what's out there and just doing a lot of deep customer work and just asking a lot of questions um and from that you start to formulate what the solution is and there's one thing I've learned in ideating and building out a business it's don't fall in love with your idea fall in love with your customer I mean that's really important for people to know because your idea is going to change and to my fault when I was first building this I probably didn't change enough I didn't pivot enough I probably didn't listen customers enough I mean I was doing it some like I feel I'm much wiser now and wouldn't make that same mistake um but I think that's a really big thing and from there you just you just keep iterating and and just figure out like okay well what are the hard things for me to do the hard thing for me in this was building out the website because I never done that and like I said it was this was before oh like even oh gosh I even remember one of the reasons I ultimately took a job at PayPal in 2011. it was because PayPal saved my butt in 2009. I actually remember I did uh credit card processing originally I signed up with an account through Costco Avalon I think was the name of the processor at the time signed up ready to go and then all of a sudden like three weeks before launch they reached out to me like uh is this a Marketplace yeah we don't do marketplaces and I'm like what like did I tell you that like I don't know what happened like I didn't even take one dollar of payments I was already paying them 30 bucks a month and they're like yeah never mind we don't do you you're you're too risky to us um and then frankly I knew I had some friends at PayPal they're like yeah yeah we'll we'll take care of you don't worry and they were and they they saved my butt and that's why I think two years later as being a Merchants for PayPal's credit card processing I was like oh this was a very logical place for for me to enter the next part of my journey but yeah I I'm sorry I went on a little side side rant there are you good like hopefully that still gets to the the root of the question I mean I think when you're ideating like again you want as big of a funnel in in the beginning as possible you want as many ideas as possible and you want to just then give it some time get away from those ideas then come back to them a day a week 10 years later whatever it is and see what resonates see what still holds true and then you start to do the research and Analysis absolutely you know as as a fledgling uh you know startup Tech startup guy myself everything that you said is is what people tell me it's what I read and but the way that you said it one thing that you said really stood out to me which was don't fall in love with your product or your idea fall in love with your customer and that I think is so critical and so important and I realized as soon as you said it you're absolutely right because one of the things that I'm working on is auto Muse which is for writers and it's like this is for writers it's you know I have ideas about what I want to build but no I I did exactly what you said which is I talked to writers screenplay uh writers I've talked to actors now um all kinds of stuff but I don't want to make this about me I just wanted to agree and reinforce that at that point um well I'm sorry just one one last thing on that like for anybody who wants to go deeper into this I will give a plug um Adobe had created an open source something called kickbox and So for anybody could go to kickbox.org it's totally it's open source it's free anyone can download it um it is kind of a way to go from ideation to business launch uh when I worked at PayPal we actually took a version We modified it and used it internally as well and it is an amazing tool that anyone can use and I probably take that that quote directly from kickbox so I do want to give do credit to them but um that's a great tool if anybody does want to go deeper uh into like how do you do this how do you really make it so you fall in love with your customer and and not get too focused on your specific solution excellent perfect yeah and uh thanks for thanks for that sharing that resource um we'll have to unpack that a little bit later too if we get if we get back around to it uh so one thing that you mentioned just a few minutes ago while while building uh sketch Maven was you know there's the the little snafu around payments you've had happy customers unhappy customers and then uh you know writing specs for engineers and kind of forgetting a few things here and there so what what were some of the interesting stories or lessons learned about like you know kind of doing everything yourself or pulling it all together and just kind of you know things that you learned the hard way I guess is a way yeah I I mean look I I think so many people I talk to I'm not technical again I started as an accountant I I I understand technology fairly well and I've always been fascinated by it but you know I I wasn't technical per se and I remember so many people I was meeting with like hey you need a technical co-founder and I was you know going to school up here at Berkeley at the time so there's a lot of technical people up there um you know getting my MBA and I actually remember interviewing a bunch of people I want somebody with the technical shops um kind of the passion for the space and there was one other thing I was looking for but basically passion for space was the one thing we had in common and then they were trying to plug gaps where I had deficiencies that's what you want in your co-founder and I really um I think I was being too picky like with hindsight like I was looking for the perfect person I interviewed a bunch of people I was you know very conscious I'm like ah I could do it myself like I I got this I could be a solopreneur I don't need to raise Venture money right now for this like I I'm gonna go off and do this thing on my own so you know I think mistake number one was not doing that because as I had mentioned I had a bunch of people on on upwork that were building this site and you know even though I didn't put that in the specs that's hey you're building a checkout you need to make sure it's secure so on and so forth it should have been known like any decent engineering team would have like kind of called that out and say like hey I don't see this in the specs are you sure that is right because every checkout we've ever like no and you know I wasn't paying that much money because I didn't look I was funding this out of my own pocket I didn't have a lot of money to do that uh but any great CTO would have caught these things much earlier and even if they weren't doing the engineering work themselves they would have you know orally a portion of it and far they would have been able to manage it much much tighter so at some point you know the site was getting decent traction decent not great but but decent and maybe about six months out so most of my focus at that time at post launch was on marketing activities and things like that that's where you want to be you want to be growth mode how do I how do I make our customers happy how do we get more inventory on the site uh within a Marketplace do you always want the balance between buyers and sellers to be someone in line because they're always going to be a little bit out of whack and it's sort of hard to to you know keep that in balance as you're moving forward but about six months in I remember waking up one morning and going out to the site like wow a bunch of new people signed up and I'm like the hell are these people and then that's when I realized I'm like oh um these are these aren't legit accounts these are Bots these are spam like this like the site's getting hacked like and there's there's some there are some interesting things ever going on there was some seeds and so forth um there are malicious code where I personally had to roll some stuff back on the site I don't think it was built very securely and God knows what we were doing with people's credit card information and so forth on this thing with hindsights um so all of that said like it was a bit of a mess and I went from spending you know 10 20 of my time worried about security I.T infrastructure to you know 80 90 percent and when you're trying to grow a business that's not where you want to be um you know the one silver lining you know I give so much credit to my my sister-in-law for just reframing my thinking on this I I remember seeing her and the rest of the family over the holidays and being just kind of really like depressed like oh gosh like I'm doing this and all of a sudden all there's all these hackers on there and all fourth and she and her response to me was well at least you built a site that was important enough for them to hack and I'm like okay there is a silver lining in that only if it really was you know the very beginning they weren't hacking again so forth so like there's somebody in Russia or wherever it was who was truly taking the time uh to do this so that was an interesting Silver Lining uh to put on all this um but just the amount of time I spent on that where it could have been on growth it was just such a lack of focus that I think it really started to kind of derail where the business could have been going that makes sense yeah and uh and and yeah you know like success is a double-edged sword right like the more the more popular you are or the more well-known the bigger of a Target you are for any number of things right well was it Sergey Brennan um said uh success breeds litigation um you know or or in this case Uh Russian hackers is what it attracts so that's right that's right exactly definitely an apocryphal or not apocryphal um uh allegorical story about how important it is to have security done right but as you mentioned earlier there's a lot of services like stripe that makes these things just out of the box much more secure and much safer so I guess I have two two directions I want to go and I'll let you pick which one we go first so in terms of where the industry is today you know the tools that are available the platforms that are available uh alternatively you did mention like a CTO could have helped you catch this so uh I'll let you pick path a or pack path B which which you want to talk about first oh like basically you're saying if I were to recreate this site today how would I do it or what would I get it yeah if you if you had all the tools today you were 10 years younger and uh and and you know had all the lessons though what would you what would you do differently I don't think I'd hire a CTO I know I I gave this whole speech basically saying how like oh that was the biggest mistake I think at the time it was the biggest mistake and look I wouldn't say I wouldn't hire a CTO but I was I would say it's not required to have a CTO because you're absolutely right um between all of the services you know there's some fairly good no code Solutions out there as well and I was getting a little bit into the code myself so I was able to tweak things here or there where there wasn't like a CMS solution I was able to kind of figure things out it was all built in PHP and you know I was able to do a lot with that but you know for security with stripe or Braintree and other products like that like it's never been easier to start a website today and so like I think you could probably build that site that I had created for 15 20 of the cost of what it cost me to do that uh in probably a half the time if not even less the other is probably gonna be a little bit of engineering support that you would need to maybe integrate some pieces but for the most part you could have this amazing secure system built with the existing tools that are out there today excellent yeah like and and so I think that that's just such a fascinating um you know uh point which is uh you know if there are folks out there and with you know historical you know like me I'm I'm talking with people I'm reading books I'm you know reading blog posts watching videos but things are changing things are different today than even they were 10 years ago or five years ago and so I just thanks for thanks for that that perspective um I had a I had a thought but it ran off um let's see looking at my notes oh yeah um so kind of kind of rewinding a little bit you had some interesting stories uh of your time at PayPal uh specifically as um as a leader of innovation so would you mind uh walking us through some of the stuff that you did at PayPal and what you learned about innovation in the tech space uh while you were there absolutely yeah and look I I spent 10 and a half amazing years at PayPal so um as as sketch me even the business the the marketplace I was running was not kind of succeeding I actually my wife and I had our first kid and it's kind of like ah is this really what I didn't want to be doing I'm like I I kind of need a I need to rethink about what I'm doing and get a steady paycheck have money flowing in instead of flowing out for a while um you know where should I go work I live in San Jose uh biking distance away from PayPal's headquarters and um I had a bunch of friends that were there I was a customer of it I always liked I mean I signed up back when they were bribing you with money in the year 2000 uh as a consumer um you know they like literally that was PayPal's when when you know for people who don't know the story one of the reasons why PayPal got to the scale it did is because they were such flush they were so flush with Venture money um and they needed to build Network effects for this to be effective buyers and sellers so um they were just giving and at one point it was up to 20 bucks a person just for signing up uh for an account I think I got in around ten dollars when when I first got my PayPal accounts but I was look I was a long time customer and from my class at Berkeley I literally knew 10 people that were working there and they all talked really favorably um so 2011 rolls around I'm looking for a job I see this this opportunity pop open on the mobile team at PayPal and I'm like oh mobile has a future um which was a uh I know now that sounds like of course Mike mobile has a future in 2022 when you're looking back at that but in 2011 even this was a few years after the iPhone still um there was some real traction but there's still a lot of skepticism um just a tiny tiny portion of transactions were being done at mobile devices even at that time even in a company like PayPal I would have that it was way under one percent of total payment volume was on mobile devices back in 2010 2011. and um so I had a really I was like well let me go interview um uh basically my interview at PayPal was talking about nothing but failures that I had at sketch Maven and um because that was my only Tech experience and look I was very open I was talking about like what I learned uh I was very candid uh another Pro interview tip that I'll give to anybody is actually listen to the earning if you're ever interviewing at a public company whether you are going for a finance role or or an engineer or a lawyer or whatever listen to the earnings call beforehand because 98 of employees don't listen to earnings calls and if you listen to an earnings call you will hear directly from the CEO and CFO and others in the company what they really care about what are the pressing things and you will actually have in some way more insight than the other people that you're talking to and just by doing that painful couple hour exercise maybe listen to the last two earnings calls you will have a whole new insight that it'll almost be like a superpower that you will have just being able to kind of talk about some of these things that the person working there is like how did you know about that well it's a public company it's on the earnings call so anyway Pro tip for anybody interview um but uh yeah so there's whatever reason they gave me a job I was dangerously unqualified for in analytics and I you know it was it was an amazing ride there I I had job after job that I was completely not qualified for but I was just wanting to try things out I was always ambitious um I always wanted to do what's best for the for the customer what's best for the team even if it wasn't in my job description and I think I'm in some ways maybe I built up a little bit of a reputation for doing that within the company and um fast forward a few years we were splitting from eBay so at the time I joined PayPal was actually owned by eBay uh 2015 um Carl Icahn comes in buys up a bunch of eBay stocks saying hey you are going to be worth more separates and um you know eBay management fights at fights it fights it and finally one day we come into work and say ah never mind we're going to split into two companies like whoa that's weird uh so when that happens PayPal has to create all these functions and so forth and I was doing a lot of things which we could get to in a bit that were pretty Innovative and and related to Innovation and um had a just really unique opportunity to kind of create a very small Innovation function but the Innovation function for what the new company was going to be and um and so that's kind of how I got involved in Innovation at PayPal and that was like my last five six years there was all within that same job kind of defining what Innovation the culture of innovation for the company looking at new products and new technologies that are emerging uh and and really working with employees across the company I'm building all that stuff out wonderful wonderful story yeah and it's it sounds like it was just a really fascinating time like you know I've learned I learned a couple a couple interesting things like I I didn't I did not know that uh Carl Icahn was the one who came in and said let's split this up and that you know because you'd think like from an outsider perspective like eBay is this big powerful tech company like why would they allow this to be spun out but it was like someone else said no if you grow apart you can be more valuable so that I mean that in and of itself is a little bit innovative but and one thing I will say is Carl Icahn was right like I mean I mean it's like you know as much as we don't like to give credit to you know and often deservedly so to like Financial corporate Raider types and so forth he was absolutely right like when it splits um when it was clear that was happening like PayPal is now uh I don't know what it is exactly probably worth at least double what eBay is at one point it was way more but things have all been kind of trending down um but like I I think that was it was pretty clear that both companies I think were actually stronger being able to focus on these different things and PayPal could actually as they just have done like can do things with Amazon and so forth when it was part of eBay it really couldn't do that eBay's even done things for their own payment systems and so forth so each company now operates truly independently years later so so yes Carl Icahn was right yeah sorry excellent yeah no great great story and great Point like you never know how things are going to turn out and and Lessons Learned you move on and it sounds like both benefited that's not always the case of course uh but you did you said that you spent the last five years or so um uh at PayPal focusing on Innovation and and you know a couple things that you mentioned that you did to focus on that was you talked to people a lot you know across the whole organization probably out of the organization outside of the organization too and you worked in the mobile space so uh if you could like paint us a picture for for me and the audience if someone wants to be Innovative or be in that space what is the mindset you need what are the behaviors you need like just like let's take a deep dive into the Innovative brain and from your perspective oh I love this this is where this is where I really enjoy talking um so what does the Innovative brain look like the Innovative brain first and foremost is just really curious it is constantly asking why it is the brain in many ways of a six-year-old just like why does that work that way why is it that we you know um you know like why do some clothes have tags on it but other ones are printed on is it a cost thing is it whatever just being naturally curious about everything that you see out there in the world um and then you know so so part and and I mentioned before like you want a big funnel of ideas because you never know what is going to hit um Thomas Edison I would love to talk about Thomas Edison like you know he he has like 1100 patents that he had and we know in convinced that light bulb and phonograph and all those things that are kind of famous now if you go down the long tail of those patents and mind you these are the things that they actually were granted patents by the USPTO we're not even seeing the ideas that were rejected that never even they're like oh this is ridiculous don't file on it when you start to go down the long tail of patents that I uh Edison has there's one specifically um you know anybody could go out there and Google like Thomas Edison baby dump and you will see like he built this talking have you seen the save it like yeah baby doll and this thing is horrific it is like it's evil it is like and it has like this weird wax cylinder thing that you play and it's supposed to talk to a kid and it's like what the it is the most god-awful thing and they're like oh yeah that's the Light Bulb Guy um but do you know what like who knows what that led to like again I mean he's just always thinking of ideas and they're not all going to be they're not all going to be home runs but like when you're coming up with ideas the first thing to I'm gonna use a baseball on another baseball analogy here but like you it batting average does not matter like that is not what matters so batting average for everyone so in baseball you come up to the plate you want to hit the ball get it into play and get on base that is called a hit all the times you don't do that is called an out relatively speaking so if you're a great baseball player um 30 of the time you're going to be able to get a hits of the times you're out there if you're a bad baseball player you know 20 of the time or even 25 percent necessarily uh to do that and but that's not the game that's being played here nobody cares about that statistic in the world of innovation all that we care about is home runs and Grand Slams like when you like basically hit it so hard it goes out of the entire stigma type stuff that is what matters um and so to do that if that is what is being measured do we care if you did it in three at bats or 3 000 at bats if all that we're measuring for is home runs and we just wanna that's the only thing that we care about well it doesn't actually matter how many times it took to do that so that is something that is really even when I had my first Innovation job it was something with with my own manager at the time was something I really had to hammer home of like we want to actually reward how many times people step up to the plate so we you know and I'm just gonna it's not the only thing but I'm gonna use patents as a proxy So within PayPal the year before I joined and again we were part of eBay so we had to parse it out I don't know we've maybe had three 400 people submit patent ideas you know um that were potentially patentable the first year I joined I think we did like three or four thousand so it was like literally 10xing that um and this was just trying to push this in the culture now was the quality of those ideas better than the year before an aggregate no I mean there's probably many more worse ideas in there but again that's not what mattered we wanted people just stepping up to the plate because you didn't know what kind of ridiculous idea might become something um you know I always joked one inventor who kept on putting ideas for like edible silverware and things like that like what does that have to do with PayPal or anything nothing but like was that a acceptable idea for us except yes yes because it's just going through the ideation process because we want like okay that doesn't here's some feedback on that now iterate improve get better in the process and so forth so you know so step one for Innovation be curious about the world learn about the world ask questions about the world step two is just come up with ideas and couple up with as many as possible and it doesn't mean you have to be submitting these ideas anywhere um you know there are some great sites like that like uh notepad.com um is a great one where you can just put like idealists and things like that I have used that for sure in the past um mostly I just put things into an Evernote actually a whole folder of Evernote files I have and I'm like these are book ideas these are business ideas these are movie ideas I don't even know what these ideas are but they're still ideas and those are kind of all the buckets I have and I just build that out and then when you're comfortably removed from those ideas kind of take a step back and reapproach them and see which ones resonate with you and most likely what is going to happen is that not any one idea is going to resonate but you're going to see value and connecting ideas that this movie idea that you had if you added it to this business idea holy cow that's really interesting what if you actually combine these we used to do a trick when when I had the Innovation Lab at PayPal where we would have people just write down ideas and topics throw it into a hats on little straps of paper and then people would just pull out two of them at a time and we're like okay given these two things what can we make out of it and we're gonna spend five minutes on this we're gonna brainstorm this and then we're gonna throw these away and somebody's gonna pick out two more random things and you know it's just an old technique to be able to apply um you know again so much of innovation is just taking two unrelated things and made into something related something powerful something that no one has ever thought of before and that's just one little hack to do that wonderful thanks so much for that deep dive into the the Innovative mindset um and so queuing off of that let's fast forward to today and uh of course we're in a hopefully a golden age of innovation with things like generative AI large language models that sort of stuff so what what do you see that's happening today what has caught your attention um in terms of Innovations and and what do you think it means uh in terms of technology or business or even the way that we live I I think the world is going to change more now than at any other point um in in my life uh I was fortunate enough to start the University of Illinois in 1995. um just as you know the the Netscape team was there like kind of building the browser and and so forth and like all the things that came from that like I had never used the internet in my life before I got to college I got there and and like literally my first day I'm like what the hell is this I don't understand this I don't even know what this is but this is amazing there's all these weird little like there's words and if I click on an underlying word it will take me somewhere else where I could learn more about that word or sometimes it takes I click and it's like like I'm like what is that that's a hyperlinkual like I had no knowledge of any of this stuff and joining like when I was at such a time where I was open to new learnings and memories like it was clear to me probably within a few weeks that this is going to change the world um and with what is happening today in Ai and generative AI like this is I feel is giddy now as I was when I was 18 years old um and learning about these things and just seeing what is possible let me Dave if I can let me let me just give my first experience I ever had with gpt3 um so one of the things I've done is uh last year yeah so I've been 2000 and uh sorry about uh 2021 I once back and started to get an MFA in writing always been passionate about writing um I read like 50 books a year I you know I'm I'm oh and I'm always like yeah I could do that but like when I grew up I was more of a science and math kid and English was kind of de-emphasize and I was kind of always like afraid of that and all everything but I'm like you know what I'm I'm gonna do this I I want to really learn how to become a great writer when I was there it was pretty clear to me like where I had a competitive Advantage was combining like my technical background and know-how with this writing skill that I'm building and I very quickly became focused on um well how can I use AI to do that so I used gpt3 for the first time on a writing project which I fully disclosed and we and I'd love to get into disclosures and things like that but for for the very first class I was taking I was writing a a little um almost kind of like a an audio drama sketch comedy type thing with all these little skits all about the presidents I'm a total nerd like yes I was writing audio sketch comedy about the presidents and had all these little sketches and so forth and one of them I wanted to write was about the president of the future and it kind of dawned on me I'm like oh what better way to do president of the future than to actually have an AI right part of that so I remember I took in and and I disclosed every single bit of what I did in my writing I took the first two lines from Obama's second inaugural address and I think I added maybe three lines of my own so it's kind of five minutes or sorry five sentences of material to start and um and I kind of hit just hit go and just to see what would happen and I remember just being amazed I'm like oh my God it's recognizing that this is a presidential speech it is kind of carrying on the same Cadence it is like recognizing that it is a computer that is writing this at some point in the future like it is carrying this on and it was doing it in ways that I never would have imagined and I remember like going through this exercise and so many times like my wife was working upstairs I think the kids were in bed already um I'm just running upstairs I'm like like look at this look at this I didn't write this I did I was so excited so I was just enamored by what was coming out of this thing and I kept doing it and you know and it actually it was a little bit glitchy too but I'm like well this is perfect like that's an angle that I never even thought of like what if giving the inaugural this you know AI computer president is glitchy and so I did this whole speech and then use some text to voice type program to do that and like boom like I made that and that was my first time using uh gbt3 and it was incredible and so after that I've I've just been like that to me is the same moments where I clicked on a link on my first day of college and it took me somewhere else like it was just completely my mind was blown and I'm like this is going to change everything fast forward a year plus to where we're at today like good god with like the things that we could do with chat GPT like I was literally just talking to my kid in the car this morning my kid does a podcast on a game called brawl Stars he's 11. he does this I'm like why don't you interview chat gbt for your podcast about brawl stars and he's like you can do that I'm like sure like do that we could do we could do this together and like like you could have this whole interview I'm sure just putting chat gbt in the in the title of your podcast going to get you a bunch more clicks and everything and like wow um and so that's going to be his project this afternoon there's just so much that can be done here um and we're just just scratching the surface of this so like that's why like this is going I I truly truly believe what we're going to see with AI um and generative consumer friendly AI is going to be more transformative I believe than the internet itself was absolutely yeah I I believe that I feel that and you know just hearing you know your perspective first time using uh uh uh web browsers seeing the internet and you know it's 1995 so fast forward more than 20 years like imagine where we'll be in 20 years so I have a few follow-up questions regarding obviously no one can predict the future like you know uh one of the stories that you told me about PayPal was uh the first time someone bought a well I think a car with PayPal mobile like you couldn't have predicted that from the invention of the iPhone right but then in hindsight it is kind of obvious um so could you tell us a little bit about that story in terms of yeah like what what you know combining new ideas and and innovating and what can you predict what can't you predict and what do you see what what are like the I guess what's the low hanging fruit with generative AI how do you think it's going to change first and and in an optimistic future what's going to be what's going to be the the the the the good timeline of uh of progress yeah yeah then we get into the evil timeline uh late later as well um so to tell this story I I remember back when I joined in 2011 uh mobile was still kind of weird it was it was still a fringe thing it was its own unit within PayPal um you know that it was a very very small part of the business and so forth and again we were owned by eBay at the time so eBay had a similar mobile team um but eBay had a whole bunch of other like kind of mobile focused one-off businesses one was called red laser which sole purpose was for scanning QR codes like so before like back in 2011 your phone if you held up the camera would not recognize a QR code you actually had to have a QR code reader and red laser was one of them um and and there are a bunch of other like little businesses within eBay and you know to the team's credit like we I remember you know not long after being there we all would kind of meet and just talk like all these businesses would just all meet together in a bid Commerce room and just like hey what are you seeing what are you finding and it was actually eBay I was on the eBay side of things um they were like we sold a car on mobile it was like one of those things like really like somebody just bought a car on a phone like you can do that like like I mean even to us it seemed kind of Novel but also a little bit of a Harbinger for like things are changing somebody just bought a car on this like that's a pretty big deal for where we might be going if somebody's willing to make that type of a purchase on this device what does that say is this just a one-off fringe is this somebody you know using their Bitcoin to buy a pizza and like well nobody's really going to replicate that anytime soon or was this something new and something special and you know those are the kind of things where you just start to see the trend you start to see the volume you start to see the change in behaviors and you know you're on to something and soon enough you know mobile is not a weird Standalone unit mobile is now the cool team to kind of be in in the company and then eventually mobile is not even a team anymore in the company it's just everything needs to be made mobile first you know much credit to uh to meta and Facebook you know Mark Zuckerberg when he was you know working on his S1 and and his executive letter at the beginning of the S1 when Facebook was going public Facebook everyone was like Facebook is going to get killed by mobile like we're moving in this mobile Direction but Facebook's gonna get killed how are you going to serve ads on mobile this real estate is not big enough it's just not going to make sense it's not going to work um he pivoted that entire company I mean because this was like this was the standard consensus that like hey like mobile doesn't work for advertising Facebook when people move to mobile you debt and Zuckerberg said okay I'm going to write this whole thing on mobile I'm moving everyone to mobile like you know they had some you know HTML5 they had some hiccups and so forth as you will when you're doing a major pivot um but he moved them in the right direction now I think he's trying to move them again with with meta and the metaverse clearly whether or not that's the right direction I guess we'll be seen I think there's still a lot of skepticism but like I guarantee you he's thinking back to 10 years ago I was right like and he clearly was 10 years ago so like this is the file he has in his head and so because he was right 10 years ago probably makes it even harder to prove him that he might be wrong uh and whether or not the metaverse may or may not be the right decision for Facebook so yeah yeah no you absolutely right and obviously Facebook or meta's stock prices reflecting a tremendous amount of let's say investor skepticism right yeah yeah um but you know so there's those pivotal moments right where where the industry insiders sense that things have changed and uh and you mentioned Chad GPT and even you know your 11 year old was like wait you can do that and uh you know it I I had that moment with chat GPT where I was like this is just another chatbot and then I saw that it passed a practice bar exam um someone used it uh do all kinds of stuff like I don't I don't know if anyone's like diagnosed um uh medical cases yet but people have used it for all kinds of things that you wouldn't think are uh are are possible yet but then um I use it to build a not a web app yet that's one of one of my next projects but it's like this thing is a force multiplier for any coder let alone whatever else is out there that it you know either in version one that it can do or subsequent versions so I think this is one of those like pivotal moments like you know it's as big as switching from you know browser-based you know computer PC based to mobile based but it's you know the underlying capacity of AI is is I'm not going to say bigger or it's not bigger or less than internet but it's different right it's very different and so let's talk about like let's let's talk about the good timeline versus the bad timeline because there's there like what are you what are you personally worried about um in in terms of what you're seeing right now well let's just talk about timeline first and then we'll get in the good and bad and I want to give a real specific example David so um in a class that I'm taking right now for my MFA um like for this semester uh I was like okay I'm gonna write a longer piece on um AIS in the classroom and so when I started this piece in August let's say um you know I started to build this up and and I actually went to schools I talked to teachers like none of them had really like like honestly none of them had heard of this even like the school my kids go to I live in Silicon Valley um it's a bunch of like Tech execs at the school and I actually went to the high school and was talking to a bunch of kids and this would have been November about gpt3 maybe 20 30 of them had ever even heard of gpt3 or or the concept I mean like they and like only one even admitted to using it like and I truly believe the others are like what are you talking about I don't know what you're talking about old man like um they didn't know and so as I'm working on this paper like it's supposed to be like a 2500 word piece you know longer interviews all this other kind of stuff um as I'm about to hand the getting close to handing this in chat gbt releases and like within a week like everything changed like like the timeline that I was thinking back in August September for how long this is going to be even I had some there was a couple art there weren't many but a few articles that I was able to find written earlier in 2022 about AI in the classroom they're like yeah this is going to start to change things just wait a few years from now this is changing everything um within like a week it started to become really clear that like oh this isn't a weak thing um you know I think Sam Altman who's the the CEO of openai had had tweeted they've reached a million users of chat GPT within five days pretty crazy now not coming here true it's a free product how many of them are true reduces you can argue all these things but still there was a million different accounts on open AI that had used this product in a very very short amount of time like that's astronomical and so to your point just like about timelines in general like it's really hard to even just predict like what the timelines are going to be because truly what I thought the timeline was going to be five months ago is nowhere near what it seems to be today and like is it just it because this is hard it's just hard for humans to imagine exponential growth I remember having I remember taking sorry I'm in a total sidebar here but I remember at the beginning of pandemic this was like February March no no it was March the kids were already out of school like we're doing homeschooling of them and I'm like I don't even know what to do with my kids at that point because like the teachers weren't really giving stuff I got to keep them busy somehow and I was like let's let's understand exponential growth now remember we got out all like we have like hundreds of Lego Minifigures and we started to lay them out and to try and explain exponential growth because part of this was also for the pandemic pandemic but I was explaining like um are not and like you know like the growth trajectory of a virus and so forth and it was really hard to grasp that and so using Legos as a visual representation of like hey this is what like linear growth looks like this is what exponential growth looks like it's shocking and just like how after like you know a few days of doubling or tripling or whatever it might be what that means that's the path that we're going down here um and even for people who are in it are aware of this you know shortcoming of us uh psychologically of just like how hard it is for us to grasp these things because like in our caveman days we never really had to deal with much exponential growth uh in any ways like this is just something for all of us like it's gonna be really hard to even understand the timeline so now to your question though so it's all right that's on the timeline to get to you know what's the good path versus the bad path look I I think I hope um that this is going to be a tool that is just going to enable more creativity that is going to be able to level the playing field so that um you don't have to have a writing partner you don't necessarily have to have um you know or have the resources to pay money for an editor you you don't have to you know translation has already kind of Gone Away in many ways but like let's just say translation or something like that if you want you know you want to read something that's in another Market or something or not written in your own native tongue like like all of these things I truly hope we'll be leveling um you know we'll level the playing field but that said like there are jobs that are going to go away there are jobs that are going to change um I don't know what that is going to look like the consensus three years ago was that like yeah if you got a blue collar job right now you're you're not in a good place um but where we seem to be today is that it's more the knowledge workers are going to be replaced by Ada AI um it's the creative types it's the designers it's the artists it's the writers um and look I I think when we start to go down this path like I don't I don't know how we're going to avoid that on a macro level on a micro level I think the people who are truly able to embrace the technology to accept it and to find a way for themselves to be more creative by using it that's where you're going to get about the value like look I I think if if you're a writer you know what are the things that writers hate writers hate marketing writers writers like to write right you know writers hate doing the the synopsis for my book the summary for for Amazon like like I I know writers and like it can sometimes take more time doing that than it can like writing like five chapters and in the book because it's like oh God I gotta do this like it's so painful like that stuff where the AI can really really help um and so if you can be a kind of person who can Embrace that for you know the not let's just say the non-value-added stuff or you know to frankly never have writer's block to just be in front of a page and say hey can you give me three different directions that I can go with this story I'm stuck here or this character Arc is giving me trouble like and to use that like I think that that's going to be really powerful again it's going to be like having the advantage of having a writing partner um which is not something we all have the advantage of having yeah no I I just want to pause and and give some appreciation to the gravity of some of what you're bringing up here because you know recently there's been a huge backlash against AI generated art and uh there's even Simone uh so I had some mild uh controversy of my own because I took down some of the tools that I was making um that would write novels or parts of novels automatically and I took it down a few months ago because I was like hold on you know most of my friends are writers and you know my fiance is a writer and I was like I don't want to hurt the people that I care about and and like you said though part of the problem is disruption at this point is inevitable like we can't put this Genie back in the bottle so what do we do and and like you said there we don't know enough right now we don't have good answers uh certainly not on the macro level so that is that is definitely something to be worried about um and then also the scale of disruption right like you know our imagination we can't imagine what it's going to be like if you know employment numbers change and of course you know historically there's one there's one Ray of Hope here is historically new technologies ultimately result in more jobs right where you know labor gets easier people are more productive there's more money to go around there's more money to spend which means demand for other services but you know of course there's the possibility that like it might not pan out that way especially if the machine is cheaper than the human labor and you just take it away from people and then who owns the machines right and then you know of course this is this is like the dark timeline speculation um and so do you have any any reactions to that or any comments or thoughts on like you know ownership or responsibility for some of this stuff yeah the thing that I'm that I do struggle most about is is really like the training models and like I that is where I'm because as humans we learn by mimicry I mean as anybody who's has a little kid or has had a little kid or been around little kids know that's that is just how we learn as humans and we carry this throughout our lives um we learn by mimicking we learn by mimicking if you know anybody who um has written as a teenager I'm sure if you still have yourself as a teenager go back and read what you wrote and it'll probably make you want to throw up because you're like oh this is just me mimicking uh Isaac Asimov or or whatever it is like that you were reading at the time was was doing that I remember writing something once as a kid I was like oh my God I just like and then like after I wrote it realized like I'm just rewriting Watchmen like it's just it didn't Dawning me though I'm like this is just ripping off Alan Moore like what am I even doing here um and that's probably how I got away from writing in in my youth um so look as humans we have always done this but like to have an AI model that is being trained on and let's just stick with art for a second on artists who may not have explicitly who have not mind you explicitly given permission to use their artwork I think that that you know are they open to some sort of compensation um are they open to saying you can't use this like I don't know how you say you can't because here's the thing like even if um okay I'm going with my comic Roots here so so there was a very um so very popular artists in the 1990s guy was named Rob liefeld who in many ways is now a punching bag for like the style that he created was kind of the epitome of 90s male machismo comic art style and but the style that he created got mimicked by so many others so even if Rob liefeld today's uh you know because I could and I've done this I've literally won into something and said hey do something in the style of Life held I'm like Ah that's it I could totally recognize this style and everything even if he said do you want you can't use my style um there's so many people that came after him that were mimicking his style that we never once said like hey even though you're making your own original work you can't mimic that you know that then creates a whole thing well then do we what if they want to be included in there what if they want to like be you know have opted in but their their own style is in some way an homage or mimicking or however you want to think of it of that like what do we do in those situations like this is something I mean so honestly this is something where I'm really sympathetic to both sides here like I I totally see both sides I don't know what the answer is and this is a really complicated question that our legal system as it exists today with copyright is nowhere near having a clear Solution on and frankly at least in the U.S the sooner we get down that path the better but here's the reality is like just one of 195 countries in the world um copyright law is very different wherever you go ask any you know author what they um you know how much money ask any American Author how much money they make for their books that are being sold in Iran and the answer is going to be zero um because basically Iran does not respect you and I shouldn't even say respect Iran does not recognize U.S copyright law so if you want to take a American blog translate into Farsi that is completely legal um to do that for example and and that's what the local laws are so you're going to have 195 different versions of them like I don't know what this is going to look like this is you know we get sense of geopolitics you know and so forth like the one thing that at least I try and do as part of all this is I just disclose like crazy so when I'm writing something um you know I will if I'm using so the example I gave before for what I was doing in my class in that one specifically I actually color coded it and and I literally said okay the green section boom and I put in footnotes where everything came from and how I was prompting like whenever I even just use an image so I write on on medium and on my on LinkedIn um if I'm using an AI image which I use lots of I will actually put this image uh was developed on mid-journey by Michael tedasco on this date from this prompt and I literally put it in there verbatim and if I said I'd use Rob liefeld as a inspiration in that I will say that um foreign it's a baby step like like I'm also not monetizing this but I'm like at least I think Step One is like being transparent with disclosure on this it makes me feel a little bit more comfortable even though like I know if I made a uh a picture of a Flying Tomato um you know even if I didn't say artist X in there artist X might still be inspiring that that makes sense yeah and and phenomenal breakdown of the problem and and again it's it uh us two talking in an afternoon is not gonna we're not going to solve this problem um but it's good to to especially as the world is catching up because again the whole reason that we're doing this podcast is things are changing so fast and you know we have an opportunity here to at least add to the conversation and help demystify it and keep the conversation moving forward so just thanks again for for coming on and sharing all of that perspective um phenomenal talk so I have uh just a few few last questions um what are you up to now um who do you want to talk to and and how do people reach you um if there's anything you want to plug or just tell everyone like what is it that Mike tedasco is up to now what do you want to be known for in 2023 what do I want to be known for oh man you're making me set my goals a few weeks early I love it I love it David um look I am super super fascinated with world of generative AI I mean the whole reason I got to meet you was just watching your YouTube videos over the summer and being like Oh my God this guy I learned so much from you in these videos of just how to think through a problem and like what are the limitations and so forth so for that I you know I deeply thank you and look I want to um meet and I want to just talk to smart people in the space um I'm fascinated I am I have no agenda in many ways like I'm I want to just learn and I want us as a society to come out in a in a better place than than what we can than what we might um I want us to not go down that dark timeline and I want us to just kind of think about it and for me I think it means like it is an inevitability like I think we in many ways as a society just have to accept that but given that like what is the best way that we can Embrace these tools for the most good and look if you're if you're a founder and working on something and you want to bounce ideas off me or you're just interested in the space or anything like that um I'd love to discuss more um so I write on medium and Linkedin as I said before uh just my last name tedasco t-o-d-a-s-c-o is um where you can reach me on both those um I'm pretty much read only on Twitter but if you do send a tweet to me you I I will respond to it um I just don't post much myself I'm also a tadasco on Twitter um uh I mean I I love just the intro like you know just today on Twitter I found out again just sorry I know we're rapping but to throw it out there I literally just saw this this morning it was a wonderful use case for um generative Ai and using um um gpt3 there's this thing called help a reporter art out agent Haro h-a-r-o and it's been around for years and I'm on it and like basically it's any reporter in the US who meets somebody who's an expert in AI or whatever it might be just puts out a request and it's this huge list hundreds and hundreds of links it's a disaster somebody just made this thing in zappier that basically says okay when you see that in Gmail um fill out this spreadsheets this will have some keywords um and then we're going to then send that we're going to do some sort of match using uh gpt3 and then um based on what they're looking for based on what you say your abilities are we're going to even generate a cover letter that you could send out to them and to just built that in zapier at like it's beautiful like it's just this beautiful thing I'm like oh my God like that was just this morning I saw that and I'm like wow you know all of these use cases it's so simple but like that I'm sure for a lot of people is going to make their life so much better it's going to make it so much easier for reporters to find people for people to find reporters and like it's taking something that was built 20 years ago I'm putting a vast Improvement for effectively zero cost on top of it wow yeah that's a phenomenal use case and that it actually reminds me so I'm a writer as well and one of the one of the possibilities that I foresee in terms of as AI gets bigger and decentralized and networked and stuff is what if what if you have a machine or an AI that just says hey I know I know who you need to talk to like you're going to be great friends with this person and makes the introduction like if you want to obviously like consent matters privacy matters but it's like hey there's someone that you might want to talk to you might you might want to go work with this person or you might want to you know uh get to know this person something like that and and what you just said like this happened like decades before I thought it would be possible just because the tools the platforms and they're recombining like you know with zapier and Twitter and Gmail and everything else and that's just phenomenal thank you for sharing that by the way that's uh that's great sure so I could sure I'll share the link as well it was it was amazing I'd love to give the credit to the person who created it so excellent perfect perfect well thanks again Mike for uh this amazing talk and everything that you do and just being well willing to help out um and yeah so for all the members of my audience uh reach out to Mike on LinkedIn and medium those are his primary stomping grounds and um who knows maybe this time next year we'll be in an entirely different world having another year-end recap so uh thanks everyone and Mike any any one or two last words um lastly look everyone just be good to others just just think I think David you you'd even said this in a recent thing just like look this is a hard time that we're going through we're going through a step change as a society through this um you know think ahead think about how we're going to help our common man and woman with what we're trying to build for this uh be good to others and um you know let's build some wonderful world changing products together excellent thanks so much see everyone next time and uh yeah be excellent to each other
