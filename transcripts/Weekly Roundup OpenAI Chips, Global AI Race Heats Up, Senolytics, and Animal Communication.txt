happy Friday everyone as has been true every week for this year it's been an exciting week in the world of artificial intelligence and the fourth Industrial Revolution so today's breakdown is going to cover five main topics uh open AI they've got a new announcement regarding making their own chips as well as caching and a stateful API we'll unpack that in just a moment I've also got some news about the global AI arms race heating up there's been some really interesting developments and I'll do a uh kind of a deep dive analysis on that so that you kind of understand the trends that I'm seeing and that I'm paying attention to that uh cause me a little bit of concern uh there's been some breakthrough research on senescent cells so this is a longevity topic uh We've also had some more AI breakthroughs talking with animals so I'll unpack that a little bit and then finally we will talk about ongoing job destruction around the world due to artificial intelligence so first up is uh open AI working on uh possibly building their own chips now one thing is uh I read the article is even if they do start making their own chips it will take a little while uh whether they're designing it or setting up their own Fabs they've also looked at potentially acquiring companies in order to uh kind of get a jump start on creating their own AI chips now this is nothing new this is what's called vertical integration and this is actually one of uh one of the it's not Innovation it's nothing it's nothing that is like unique or anything but vertical integration has become much more popular in the tech space particularly after uh people seeing the success of Tesla and SpaceX so what you might not realize is one of the reasons that space flight is so incredibly expensive is because of enormous uh supply lines and you know Parts being made all over the place and so one of the things that Elon Musk did in terms of making space cheaper is vertical integration so vertical integration means that uh rather than buying a part uh from outside of the company you build it all inhouse and so this makes sense this actually kind of runs contrary to business Theory and business philosophy particularly in the 70s and 80s as uh as Logistics became more sophisticated it it was more about Outsourcing and so instead of Outsourcing now we're insourcing and onshoring uh so this this move doesn't surprise me and I suspect that uh as these uh resources become more and more commoditized uh we're basically going to eventually see AI chips just like any other processor which is actually why companies like IBM sold off their entire server and laptop unit because computers are are seen as Commodities now so moving forward uh and directly relevant to this is the global AI arms race so this news was it's a little bit understated but to me uh this move by some Southeast Asian uh countries really um it kind of I'm I'm not saying that this is a warning shot it's not a shot across the bow um this is just it kind of makes sense so the tldr here is that uh the the aan the as asan uh Nations which is kind of like the EU but for Southeast Asia not exactly one for one but you get the idea um the idea a here is that they are taking a more business friendly kind of more libertarian approach to AI regulation so that's the hands-off regulation uh which runs very contrary to what the EU is doing and of course like there's been some push back against the EU AI act because it was uh it was pretty strict in terms of Consumer Protections I tend to agree with that however in the grand scheme of things you know yes with global economics you can use sanctions and other diplomatic things in order to try and coers uh other nations or other blocks of Nations into uh cooperating but in the grand scheme of things this is a global scale game of geopolitical economic scientific and technological chess and the writings on the wall as everyone knows today at least almost everyone knows and agrees uh obviously there's some holdouts but in general it is understood that the countries and companies that move fastest and furthest on AI will have a distinct Advantage not just economically but socially and militarily so there is no incentive for countries to slow down and this is what I and others have been saying since the the infamous pause letter came out what was it almost six months ago already seems like yesterday um but you know and it's like we knew that that was a failed idea like you cannot slow this down um and you know private Enterprise they're going to do what's in their best interest militaries are going to do what's in their best interest governments are going to do what's in their best interest so it's basically like you know strap in get ready for blastoff we are all along for the ride when this is actually a big component of my research because my assertion as other people uh are coming to realize is you can't stop this you can't have some high-minded ideal like uh what some of the CEOs are saying like oh well we should never make it agentic or you know we should do this that or the no you have to assume that this is a uh an imperfect environment a highly competitive environment where basically anything goes and so in that case basically you're stuck in what I call terminal race condition which is you're trying to optimize for Speed as much as anything else and other people call it a race for the bottom it's not necessarily a race for the bottom because there are also advantages to being smart and ethical the smarter and more ethical your AI is the more trustworthy it is and the less oversight it requires I've talked about this in some of my recent videos where putting effort into lying and being deceptive that is all wasted effort in my opinion so uh pay attention to how uh things play out between you know it seems like the the the three primary centers of gravity for AI is America Europe and Asia uh which of course like that's most of the world I'm just excluding like the global South uh from that but anyways point being is that um this is a really interesting development it's not surprising but it is still concerning and it's to watch uh more specifically uh as you may or may not remember earlier this year the Biden Administration placed a pretty heavy uh trade embargo uh a on AI chips going to China and there has this is again it's not too surprising but there's been some push back from the big uh silicon uh players Nvidia Intel and Qualcomm they're pushing back on that now because they're saying you know well here let me just give you the summary first uh cutting sales to China obviously if you can't sell to someone that's bad for business this is part of the globalist policy that's been into place since uh the 1970s and 1980s which is uh you know economic interdependence uh reduces your chances of going to war with people because if they have Goods that they buy from you and goods that you buy from them you don't want to shoot yourself in the foot and so trade embargos particularly with gigantic trading partners like between America and China generally it's a lose lose situation but you do that for geopolitical and Military reasons uh now another thing is uh and this is actually kind of surprising because some people predicted this and of course China is incredibly adaptive so like I think it was like literally within days of the Embargo being announced China internally announced that they were going to say okay well we're just we'll just develop our own internal expertise our own internal fabri uh you know chip Fabs and we won't need you so they're like take a hike we don't care um so you know there's there's many possible unintended consequences and intended consequences from the uh chip embargo going to China but you know basically if you cut someone off and then they have to develop their own internal expertise that is a chance for them to then kind of say well we don't need you anyways however uh despite uh you know so for instance what I'm one thing that I'm thinking about is a few years ago Vladimir Putin in Russia said you know the company or the country that you know dominates AI will dominate the world something like that I know I'm misquoting it uh but basically despite knowing the value of that and despite having literally hundreds of billions of dollars um to invest Russia was never able to develop the internal expertise to catch up or compete on the global stage with respect to artificial intelligence now that being said China is far more organized and far richer than Russia so if they set their mind to it it's entirely possible that yeah cutting off trade with China means that they're just going to have their own little isolated island of AI expertise and it it in the worst case scenario it will be like a new Cold War where you know the Soviets were developing Science and Technology independent of and parallel to the West uh and and so this there's actually a lot of people that are predicting that we might end up in in like segmented internet world again um which that would be interesting one way or another I'm not I don't actually know whether or not that's a good thing or a bad thing until we learn to come together as a global species one of my long-term goals is to uh is to help steer Humanity towards Utopia and part of what I view as utopia obviously there's different uh definitions of this but I think we can all generally agree that like world peace is a good idea um and part of part of world peace is open communication so I I think that segmented internet and and having you know different different uh hemispheres of the world having fundamentally different approaches to artificial intelligence and Ai and internet would probably be a bad thing in the long run okay so moving right along this news comes I think uh yesterday or the day before and I didn't pay too much attention to it at first but uh some of my some of my patreon supporters were talking about it and so I gave it a second look and it's it's a it's kind of interesting but unfortunately there's not a whole lot of news yet but what open AI is teasing is that at their upcoming developer conference they're going to introduce what they're calling a stateful API which could lower the cost of using the the the chat GPT API as much as 20 times like so 20-fold reduction in cost so they haven't released the details yet but um in reading about it and talking with with people it looks like it's some form of caching um so that that way like it it it maintains the conversation State now I don't know if that just means that it records the text of the conversation or if maybe they found a more efficient way of reducing cost which maybe it just records the embedding because uh for those that don't know the way that chat GPT Works internally is it the there's the there's the it's a Transformer architecture so on the input side it creates an embedding and that embedding is I think it's a 12,000 uh Dimension Vector that just it's a semantic representation that says hey here's here's where the conversation is at but you don't need you know walls and walls of text it's all recorded in the embedding and so if that's what they're doing which is what I suspect they're doing in that case all you have to do is record an embedding and say the conversation state was at this you don't need all the text you don't need to rebed that Vector every time instead what you do is you split the model in half so and who knows maybe it is split in half internally where they've got the embedding side and then the decoder side or the encoder and decoder side um and so then the stateful API might just say okay here's a uid connecting to this embedding so all you have to do is refer to this uuid and you can carry on the conversation from wherever you left off if I were them that's how I'd approach this but as a uh infrastructure engineer and Global Solutions architect um at other tech companies that's how i' approach it in terms of uh both increasing performance cuz if all you have to do is Sid load a vector rather than embed an entire thing that'll be faster but it'll also be much cheaper because you're it comes down to Watts every watt you have to spend um redoing and embedding is wasted energy so you know reduce reduce reduce just cut down on any excess like so one rule of thumb that I have whenever I'm doing automation work is process something once um if you can process something and then record it um if the act of recording is cheaper um to to energetically speaking and time speaking then that's going to be more efficient and so I've often talked about how you know whenever people ask me like Dave how do I get around this limitation or how do I reduce costs my my response to all of my clients and and everyone who asked me is just wait because chat GPT 4 is like 10 times cheaper than gpt3 was a year or two ago and a year or two from now it'll be 10 times or in this case 20 times cheaper uh and so you get these compound returns where you know like you instead of exponential growth it's exponential decay so you know the cost per token used to be 10 cents now it's 4 cents soon it'll be 1 cent then it'll be you know basically trivial cost before too long uh especially as you know uh the chips get better the models get leaner and more efficient uh and other efficiencies are found not just necessarily in the model but in the rest of the software architecture and training and all that stuff so uh pay attention to the space I this is why I wanted to include this though is just like just wait you know you you'll see 10x drops in cost 20x drops in cost eventually you'll see 100,000x drops in cost and of course every time that these models get smarter cheaper faster better safer that also makes them a greater threat to jobs which we'll talk about in just a minute okay so this is super exciting I mentioned this on LinkedIn and I I made a previous video about it but the ace framework the autonomous cognitive Entity framework paper is live on archive it is officially published and released obviously archive is a pre-print server um this hasn't been to conference yet to you know to be peer reviewed or anything but my open source team um is we just finished the first Sprint on on building a proof of concept so actual code applied at this we had a we had a demo day yesterday was an internal demo day and we learned a lot we shared a lot of notes we recorded it um so we're working on a high highlight reel from that demo day but yeah so this is really exciting the code is happening one of the most important things and I'm not going to like rehash everything but the most important takeaway from the team conversation yesterday which was a two-hour conversation um was that there are no technical barriers to progress everything that we're trying to do and everything that we need the models to do they are capable of doing all of the all of the infrastructure that's underpinning the architecture all of the vector search databases all of the message cues like literally all the pieces are there we just have to assemble it and we have to do some of the prompt engineering figure out the meta prompting strategies figure out the communication between the layers um but this stands in St contrast to my earlier work on cognitive architectures where gpt3 was good it just wasn't good enough even with fine-tuning it just wasn't smart enough the context window wasn't big enough but but particularly GP PT 3.5 turbo and GPT 4 these models are smart enough and they're good enough and also I had a few friends uh join the team who are uh experts in open source models so that was actually one of the biggest most consistent comments and requests both in the comments in the previous video and discussions on the uh GitHub which is now that people are seeing that cognitive architecture and autonomous agents are eminently possible there's a tremendous amount of interest in getting this over to open source uh for numerous reasons not the least of which is just more control over the models but we've also seen some recent um studies and demonstrations that you can get really good performance out of very small models I think the most recent one was that a 7 billion parameter model outperformed a 70 billion parameter model and so when you have models that are that small you can run them locally and that is better for privacy it's better for Safety and Security and there's all sorts of reasons that this is better now obviously these Frontier these Flagship models like G G pt4 they're the smartest and most powerful but the open source space is actually accelerating so you might remember at the beginning of this year 6 to 12 months ago uh where people were like oh yeah open source is good but it's a year or two behind now open source is only a couple of weeks to a couple of months behind these Frontier models uh which is really exciting and it's good news for us but it also goes back to what I was talking about where the genie is out of the bottle like we cannot contain AI it is impossible to to even try and contain it so don't bother instead what we need to do is align it and make it autonomous and and safe and trustworthy so that uh it aligns with us and we align with it and um that's my opinion obviously so that's uh that's it for the ace framework I do have a couple really small announcements before we get to the rest of the video first I've got a new substack I'm moving away from medium because a lot of people complained that Medium was paywalled and I was like no it's not um but I realized that um I actually don't know how medium Works cuz some things are pay waled and some things aren't and it doesn't ask me um so anyways I'm moving away from medium to substack um Link in the description I also just activated Channel membership so I'm still working that out but uh at the at the very Baseline level uh if you become a YouTube channel member your comments get top priority you get a set of unique uh cool emojis I I made those by hand uh well by hand with Dolly uh and you also get some some uh unique Raven badges also I've got books merch and a little bit more coming soon so I'm working on a systems thinking book on my other channel my neuros spicy Channel my systems thinking series is by far the most popular series of videos so I'm going to make a whole book uh teaching you how to think like I do um and then I've also got a Sci-Fi uh right now it's a duy but it might be a Trilogy that I'm working on I've I've been referring to this for a while um there's also going to be some 4ir swag we've got uh like some some mugs and stuff that we're working on um probably some T-shirts and other stuff there's going to be exclusive offers to my patreon supporters substack subscribers and channel members as well as some Early Access to this stuff and of course I've also got the uh exclusive Discord where we talk about neuros spicy stuff and Ai and uh existential coping the uh the existential coping thread is is one of the most popular threads anyways my goal Remains the Same is I want to maximize the chance of success of humanity not just surviving but thriving in the future so literally everything that I do is based on Grassroots support so really appreciate everyone who uh chimes in chips in whatever way that you can like subscribe comment or support me on any of these other platforms all right back to the show so job destruction is something that I talk about a lot I talk about post- labor economics where basically the the central idea of post labor economics is that uh getting rid of humans from the work force is a good thing um and that we should actively work to automate away the need for human labor because it is the greatest constraint on uh progress and productivity now that being said that represents a very fundamental uh paradigm shift in terms of how we even think about economics so I'm always Keen to pay attention to um news and evidence of uh AI destroying jobs because the thing is is right now there's no evidence that AI is creating new jobs sure we've had uh comments from from various CEOs saying oh we're not going to fire anybody but then it's like yeah like but you have a hiring freeze and you just laid off 7,000 people and you created only a th000 new job openings so even if you're you're saying that AI is quote creating new jobs it's creating far fewer than it's destroying that is of course what it seems like is happening now so in this case this was another example where it seems like the the the lowest hanging fruit for AI to replace is obviously uh graphic artists have been greatly harmed by uh image generators the Hollywood riter strike just ended Rec recently so AI you know for writing so basically creativity was the first thing the second thing seems to be CSR customer service representative jobs are the next on The Chopping Block in terms of uh victims of the AI thing now honestly like when you think about it a CSR is kind of like a telephone operator and of course telephone operators went out of work decades ago so and I'm not obviously like what a CSR does is much more sophisticated than what a telephone operator does but because it is such a narrowly constrained and defined job um I think that's what makes it very vulnerable to Total automation because once you have voice and once you have conversational ability there's a whole bunch of jobs that are just imminently going to go away and you look at the progress of like open AI whisper and 11 Labs with voice synthesis you can even have face-to-face conversations with fully digital avatars or what I call metahumans the a metahuman is a fa simile it is a copy without an original so uh metahumans are probably the creepiest thing so what I and we've already seen this actually with um influencers and creators and YouTube personalities that like they look like real people but they were never real people and you've probably seen it referred to as like fake humans I call it metahumans um to be a little bit more specific but the idea is that we are creating AI in our own image which says a whole bunch of stuff about our deep unconscious psychology and Freudian stuff which I'm not going to get lost on that rabbit hole anyways long story short uh kind of got carried away there uh is that uh job destruction is coming and I still haven't seen any evidence of job creation from AI at least not any substantive uh job creation if you have please let me know in the comments cuz I'm happy to follow up um on on that kind of stuff so but yeah uh last or second to last is animal communication so this has been kind of a a recurring uh theme this year where AI is more and more being used to communicate with dolphins or at least decipher what things like dolphins and whales are saying as well as the chirps of like um what was it not was it field rodents or field mice or something like that anyways we are getting better and better at using artificial intelligence in order to understand the communication of animals and the thing is the most important thing here is what the ability to communicate implies about Consciousness and sentience I remember watching uh a documentary about Coco the gorilla who was able she was able to use sign language in order to express desires and emotions and wants and there was maybe there is still controversy but I remember at the time there was a lot of controversy saying oh well this isn't communication she's not actually expressing unique thoughts she's just matching some Behavior to uh getting something that she wants instrumentally she knew how to ask for berries she knew how to say like you know want water but uh I read the book um language Instinct by Steven Pinker and as a language expert he un he debunked like that push back against coko like wasn't actually sentient or whatever because she was able to express emotions when she heard that Robin Williams had died and she had met Robin Williams she said that she she signed cry and something else I don't remember but like she had an emotive expression um and then there was another there the funniest instance was um she got upset and ripped her sink off the wall and then blamed her kitten so the ability of a of a of a of a gorilla to do something to understand that there would be consequences and then to lie about it so this is this is an animal that is not human but has the ability to deceive so that implies a lot about cognition um which you know i' I've recently done videos about AI being able to deceive us whether or not it's deliberate and intentional is another question uh but anyways I I think that what we will come to find as we communicate with animals more and more is that our definition and our understanding of Consciousness and sentience is going to expand a lot obviously there's many many of you uh in my audience that already understand this and believe that uh Consciousness and sentience is far more broad spectrum than just humans but there are also plenty of people who make an argument that Consciousness and sentient sentience is exclusively a human thing um let me know in the comments where you where you fall on that Spectrum maybe I'll run a poll later I'm not really sure and finally last but not least is research on CTIC cells so uh obviously this is a little bit different from artificial intelligence but longevity is a huge topic here uh in the fourth Industrial Revolution and so if you're not aware what a cytic cell is it's basically just an old cell but what happens is I watched a full documentary on this so I can tell you a little bit more about the key thing that's going on here cytic cells are old and what they do is they start broadcasting inflammation signals and so these inflammation signals basically say I'm old and crotchy like we're slowly dying and what we have found is that if you just get rid of senolytic cells the organism as a whole um is I don't know if they live longer but they're certainly healthier and so just by getting rid of these little like old geriatric cells that are broadcasting uh inflammation signals these reactive oxygen species uh then the overall organism becomes healthy and more uh rejuvenated so this is one component of Aging it is not it's not a complete solution to aging but it's like okay well you add cytic break uh you know treatments with you know a few other like maybe telr regeneration and a few other you know uh aspects it's entirely possible that this will become one component of a full package of Rejuvenation Therapies in the long run and the reason that I included this is because I have seen so many articles about senolytics cell uh targeting this year so this seems like it's kind of the next uh most eminent Frontier so I wouldn't be surprised if within the next year or two and maybe it's already here um but people working on uh getting FDA approval for cellytic drugs that will basically you take a drug and your body's inflammation uh score goes down and you age much much slower we'll see if that's uh how it plays out so anyways thanks for watching let me know how you like this format uh people tend to like how I do deep Dives on things and unpack stuff and kind of tell you what it means um obviously there's plenty of other channels that do news um but I think let me know if you like my particular take on it and um yeah I'll adjust accordingly thanks for watching have a good one
