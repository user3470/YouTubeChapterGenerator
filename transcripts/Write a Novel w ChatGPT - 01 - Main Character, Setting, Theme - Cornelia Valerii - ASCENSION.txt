hey everyone David Shapiro here with another video today we're going to be doing chat GPT for writing fiction specifically writing long-form fiction like novels obviously this is a practice that takes a while so in this first video I'm hoping to just get to a solid outline and then we'll call it a day before we get started though I wanted to explain that uh I have monetized some of my YouTube videos uh people are getting a lot of value out of them um and I want to take the ads out but I was not able to get my uh patreon goals met so my goal is to get to four thousand dollars a month so that I can uh pay all the pail of my bills have health insurance that sort of thing um and then I can permanently demonetize all of my videos that is my goal now if people would prefer ads we can do that I don't really care one way or another but it would be good if uh if if we can do it this way all right so without further ado let's talk about writing stories so this is something that I have spent a tremendous amount of time on uh personally um writing is uh is one of my top hobbies and it's how I met my now fiance and so uh in fact one of the things that attracted a lot of people to my channel was using these language models to write fiction and uh in point of fact chat GPT completely changed some of my plans around my auto Muse Suite of tools um so because of that like I'm not going to try and compete with chat GPT why bother right I'm gonna do something else in the meantime let me show you how to think about this uh tool so that you can write fiction long form fiction anyone can do it um but you kind of you got you got to know about like writing a story so um I have the advantage of I had a premise already in mind so the premise that I had in mind was that I wanted to write a story from the POV of a courtesan during the Golden Age of Rome and I wanted it to be like a palace Intrigue kind of story but also the Golden Age of Rome or the the height of the Roman power there's a huge amount of stories that can be told in that you know there's um uh there's you know whether it's Augustus or Caesar and Gaul or whatever is going on in Egypt or you know the Revolt of the Jews or whatever there's all kinds of cool stuff so um the way that I like to start these kinds of conversations is you just tell it what you're doing so you say hey I'm writing a novel um I need your help I found that if you're polite it like it it it copies your tone so if you just if you're very thorough and polite it tends to be more helpful um if you just give it like flat instructions it's usually willing to help as well but I mean there's no nothing wrong with being polite to the machine um it also feels good to be polite um I'm writing a novel and I need your help um this is a uh Palace Intrigue slash uh historical fiction slash Adventure uh set during uh the Golden Age of the Roman Empire it follows um uh a courtesan um so help me brainstorm this story the goal today is to get a very solid outline so if you tell it what your goal is um it's like sure let's do that um what questions do you have so if you if you tell it if you if you finalize it with saying that ask me questions if this is where the power of a dialogue comes in because you might be making assumptions in your mind that are not going to translate um so let's see it says sure I'm happy to help brainstorm ideas for your novel to get started can you give me some more information about the Curtis courtesan and her role in the story what is her goal or motivation do you have any specific historical events or figures that you would like to incorporate these are phenomenal questions okay um great questions and I'm saying this as a I'm not a I guess I am a semi-pro writer I have made some money from writing fiction um but uh I'm also just a very passionate writer and I uh a good like more than half of my friends are writers that's like my social life um the other half is all AI people um okay great questions so um well I really wanted to have a close visceral experience of um the Roman world uh during its height um for instance I really love the Intrigue of Assassin's Creed Odyssey um I also really loved the book cushiel's Dart and if you know what cushel's DART is you know that it's a very spicy story we're not going to go that spicy at least Well Chad GPT will get mad at me if I try and go that spicy We're not gonna we're gonna toe them no I'm not gonna get demonetized over that um so we'll just leave it at that um so that's the kind of story I want to tell um I'll need help uh fleshing out um the characters so for for some reference the reason that I have some of this knowledge already is because I was using my own tools Auto Muse tools while I was brainstorming this those are still being built but they've been kind of put on the back burner we'll get to that later but the tools are coming um I'll need help fleshing out the characters um backstories motivations goals um now in terms of um uh historical events or characters I was thinking maybe um Augustus or Hadrian um or some of the uh five good Emperors uh basically I want a setting that is um that allows for anything to go celebrations opulence battles piracy Etc make sense all right so let's see what chat GPT says yes I understand what you're looking for it sounds like you want to create a sweeping epic story set during the height of the Roman Empire with a courtesan as the main character to help flesh out the story and characters we could start by brainstorming some ideas for the courtesan's background and motivations for example what was her life like before she became a courtesan what letter did that profession and what are her goals within it does she have any personal or professional relationships um let's see in terms of historical events the Reigns of Augustus and Hadrian would provide a rich backdrop as they were both significant figures and the rule coincided with a time of prosperity and expansion including events um could add to the historical reality okay cool is there anything specific you would like to include um okay great so um first let's brainstorm the MC a shorthand for main character um uh during another brainstorming session one idea was that she was a slave seeking Liberation uh but I'm not sure if that works um another idea was that she was from um a lower family um maybe uh I guess maybe a patrician um maybe a poor Patrician family I don't remember if the attritions were still around um so uh maybe let's brainstorm some around that can you uh give me some more ideas so one thing with chat GPT is you have to be very specific about what you ask for um whereas interacting with a human there's a lot of uh based on my recent interview with Anna Bernstein um which she pointed out that like with a human there's there's an implied intent um what with the machine you have to be very explicit um okay perhaps she was born into a poor Patrician family and was struggling to make ends meet she was forced to leave home at a young age make her way in the world she may have turned to courtesan work to earn a living um then her goal may be Beauty charm gained powerful uh gain the favor of powerful men and women alternatively she should have grown up she could have grown up in a wealthy family but fallen on hard times due to financial mismanagement political scheming oh that's good that's some good Intrigue oh yeah I like that and so here's where like just asking it to give me ideas and then I pay attention to what resonates with me and so then it follows my lead another possibility was orphaned and had to make her way on the streets that's not quite as interesting um you know like a Rags to Riches thing but since I want to do a palace Intrigue this this middle one looks good um yeah I like that middle one um of somewhat Fallen fortunes that's very consistent with um Palace Intrigue uh and also sets her up with a strong motivation for revenge and Justice and getting back to her um uh what's the word uh desire not desired um deserved station um okay so that's a powerful through line let's now think about the theme um of this story the universal truth can you help me Workshop that now um so I want to pause and and point out that like okay how did how do how do you as the person following along know what to do so I am following uh kind of my personal pattern of when I'm coming up with a new story so you start with a premise so premise is usually just the setting and the main character um that's like oh I've got this great idea for a story so setting in main character then you develop that main character and explore their interaction with the setting because there's three pillars of writing fiction and that is plot setting and character we'll get the plot in a little while hopefully that's where we'll end today but setting in character so character is the human um and then the setting is the world that they're in and um they're those are intrinsically intertwined um and then the the thing that guides the whole story the purpose of the story is like the beacon on the hill or the lighthouse that you're heading towards that is theme and so theme is the universal truth the universal um lesson that is in it and so in uh popular fiction lately um you might have remembered this uh it was vaguely popular uh movie called Avengers end game where this uh big purple dude named Thanos wants to erase half of Life uh in the universe so the theme there is the arbitrariness of catastrophe right storms will just kill at random plagues will kill at random volcanoes will kill at random Thanos represents that uh the cataclysm right he is the death blight of of um of just our existence um and so let's see what it says so because we have to figure out the theme um like why is it that I wanted to set this at the Golden Age of Rome and of these somewhat Fallen fortunes so let's see if we can figure out let's see if we can pull a theme out that is going to be the guiding force or The Guiding energy of this story um okay so to identify the theme it might be helpful to think about the central message or lesson you want your readers to take well duh that's what I'm asking um what is the main character struggling with and how does she overcome what does the main character learn about herself in the world uh as the story progresses what is the story saying about human nature or The Human Condition answering these questions can help you identify the underlying ideas or principles okay sure for example the main character is struggling with the challenges of living in a rigid hierarchical Society oh here we go we're getting into the good stuff here ultimately find able to find her place in it the theme of the story might be something like finding one owns one's own path in life or the power of self-determination on the other hand if the main character is struggling with issues of identity or belonging um the theme might be something like the search for one's true self or the importance of community okay so what this isn't what what this is implying here is that um a character's Arc their personal journey is is what exemplifies and carries the theme and so you can look you can often look at them as this is not always true but one of the easiest ways to do theme is what is it that they learn what is it that they overcome along the way now you can have a theme that does not directly impact a character's Arc and that and that the theme is actually in the setting so a good example of that is that one of the one of the the overarching themes in The Witcher um the Netflix show is one of nihilism and that is that everything is pointless and this is and that is put in the uh the world the setting the where the setting punishes people for having hope because that is the opposite of of nihilism right um and so geralt then is a reflection of the the world that he lives in but he kind of has a flat character Arc because he's just I know what the world is like and it's an awful place and I'm not gonna fight it um but his personal truth is that you can't fight Destiny um so that's you can have multiple themes okay great um so it did it it's it's framing it we're getting there but let's let's do this a little bit more um because it it one of the things that I don't like about chat GPT is that sometimes it'll just kind of tell you how to approach a problem rather than solving the problem now this is okay because sometimes just knowing what to do is is important but um sometimes I'm just like no just solve the problem for me um so I'll say let's think through this um let's think through this um uh let's see the setting is the um is the apogee of the Roman Empire what does that tell people there's an abundance of wealth and power and possibility um so that feels important and then um the MC uh has lost her station but wants it back um so again what does this um say about um Humanity or Universal truths um can you help me articulate this theme let's see what it says the setting of your story during the height of the Roman Empire suggests a time of great prosperity and opportunity but also time of strict social hierarchy and rigid rules of behavior this could be seen as a metaphor for the larger Human Experience where opportunities and limitations are often determined by factors such as birth wealth and status and gender the main characters struggle to regain her former status in place in society could be seen as a reflection of the human desire for recognition and respect ooh okay and the lengths that people will go to in order to achieve their goals this could be lead to a theme the pursuit of power and success or the cost of ambition alternatively the main character's Journey could be seen as a commentary on the capriciousness of Fate ouch um so capriciousness is um Mercurial emotions that's what capricious means is when when um something is very fickle um so the capriciousness of fate and the dangers of relying on external factors for one sense of worth and identity in this case the theme could be something like the fragility of success or the importance of self-acceptance I hope these ideas give you inspiration so this is actually zeroing in on what we had worked on before before Chad gbt um so let's do both actually let's have her pursue power um and status and then um when she gets it she realizes that she's alone hunted and uh and empty um so then she must make a choice um to let it all go and pursue uh genuine human connection I think this will parallel um today's Zeitgeist of uh quiet quitting and um and reclaiming our lives um what do you think okay it says I think that could be a powerful and resonant theme for your story having the main character initially pursue power and Status only to eventually realize the emptiness and isolation that comes with it could be a compelling Arc that reflects the idea of the cost of ambition this could be a great way to explore the theme of the importance of genuine human connection and the dangers of relying on external markers success for one sense of worth and fulfillment to further develop oh now it's suggesting stuff to further develop this theme you might consider exploring the main character's Journey from striving for external validation to finding a sense of purpose and meaning within herself this could involve showing her struggles with feelings of inadequacy or loneliness as well as moments of self-discovery and connection that help her to see the value of her own worth and relationships yes this is great I think we need to uh break this into a duology the first book will be called Ascension or something uh grandiose like that and the second book could be called um descent or something um and so I really like this and I'm totally gonna finish this and you guys are gonna go on this journey with me as however long it takes because this is a story I've wanted to write for a while but it's like I don't even know where to begin um because uh it's also because it's a historical fiction there's a lot of research that you need to do in order to keep it accurate um so like you know we haven't even explored dates and times of like you know uh Augustus or Marcus Aurelius or Hadrian um so we'll figure that out in a minute because we we do have to flesh out the setting um okay that's all nice and solid now um Let's uh let's summarize everything we've got up to this point please write a detailed uh summary of The Story So Far So you want to do this every now and then because especially when you're doing long form fiction um it it does chat GPT does have a limited memory so you want to you want to kind of like okay let's stop let's circle the wagons let's figure out exactly what's going on and see it got one thing wrong where it's um it says poor Patrician family um so we actually want to say that she started as a with a as a in a powerful family um through her beauty charm and wit the main character is able to gain the favor of powerful men and women and she Rises to position of influence however she becomes more successful she becomes she begins to realize the emptiness and isolation um yep she must ultimately make a choice between her ambition and genuine human connection um the first book titled Ascension follows the character's rise to power um the second book descent explores her journey from striving for external validation to finding a sense of purpose and meaning with herself as she grapples with the choices she has made and the consequences from them excellent um we just need to change one detail um she starts um or she was born to a powerful and so this is where I thought something and said something but didn't tell it um she was born to a powerful and Wealthy family uh but uh her family was um dispossessed uh due to uh betrayal and Palace intrigue can you update the summary based on this info excuse me um certainly here's an updated summary and so by getting it to restate it we can then see how the machine understands the story and this is the same thing as as we what we do with humans um which is called reflective listening so um I am asking it to reflect back to me what it understands that I want so using reflective listening with chat GPT is a really powerful technique I'm going to do a quick time check because um oh wow we're already 22 minutes in um I want to keep these videos reasonable um so we're we're we've got like the main through line we've got a little bit of the setting um so let's try and get a little bit further with the setting and then let's start trying to outline a plot um great let's flesh out the setting now um can you help me figure out when exactly to set this story when do you think um the Roman Empire hit its absolute Peak raging okay trajan was an effective ruler uh and popular ruler and he ruled for almost 20 years okay so that's a that's a good period of time um so Augustus was earlier Hadrian came after oh let's do hatred let's do trajan to Hadrian um so her life takes place during the entirety um of these guys okay great um uh let's set this so that uh her birth coincides with the um Ascension of trajan um so uh so she's partly uh marked the Romans were very superstitious um as being tied to the fate of the emperor um so then so then her life goes um uh so then her her character Arc follows Rome through its absolute Peak and the beginning of the decline so her choices mirror that of Rome okay with this in mind can you list all the major events and people and uh well I get yeah events and people that we should think about from let's see 98 A.D to 138. 80. um this will help us figure out what uh beats later okay certainly here are some of the major events and people from the period of 98 80 to 30 138.80 um so this is her 40-year life basically um and then we can have because you know during Roman times Roman matrons tended to live a lot longer than Roman men mostly due to uh conflict but not always because you also had much shorter life expectancies of of women in general due to death during childbirth but once a woman made it past childbearing years she was their life expectancy was pretty similar to that of today with the exception of like things like plagues happening um okay antonine wall the bar Cobo Revolt the Jewish Rebellion Ayah there's that one take takes place in Palestine um because one of the things that I thought of is if she's a if she's a courtesan then maybe she's attached to very powerful people and goes all over the Roman World which could be really interesting um yep okay so this is this is the the Roman parthian War so that's way out east um which is not yet now I Ran So there were there's lots of uh horses and stuff so because cushiel's Legacy is one of my favorite stories I'm thinking about like what if she goes on these Adventures to like save the Empire or something um and and this is how she gets powerful um and then she starts touring with with Hadrian or something um I really like this actually um okay so so these are just a few examples um let's focus on her earlier life for a minute um she would have been about 12 during 110 whoops 110 A.D um what happened around then um anything political or economic that we can base the fall of her family on okay so if it says like I don't know what's happening in your character's life um okay so it's confused I'm I'm actually asking for um real real events so I'm going to do a quick refresh this is a trick that I have you can interrupt it with a with a solid refresh and then um and then you can go and regenerate it I'm like no no no let's not do that um okay what was happening in Rome around 110 80. um I am mostly curious about political and economic events um in and around the Imperial City foreign if you're watching please add a cancel button because you you don't want the conversation to be polluted in fact if we could go back and delete the bad messages um and and clean it up as we go so if we can flag something to say remove this from the conversation that would be fantastic okay During the period around one uh was enjoying a time of relative peace and prosperity trajan was an effective and popular ruler there was likely a great deal of political and economical activity um let's see many public works okay the expansion of the city's Aqueduct system um oh okay sure let's go with that sure let's go with that um let's say the MC's um family was involved in um these Major Works they were sponsoring and um and organizing um big projects but uh wealthier um wealthier or more well-connected family wanted in because they were very um a very lucrative and high highly coveted projects um so let's imagine that um her family's Fall From Grace was um was part of that scheme um let's go ahead and name these families and people can you recommend some uh clan names and uh given names for our characters um we need at least the MC her family name um and then the Rival faction name well certainly here are a few suggestions for clan names and given names you might use plant names Claudius this was a common clan name in agent Rome and it was associated with several influential families flavius this was another one um Aurelius so the claudians and the flavians these are uh I don't want to be necessarily that on the nose um and I'm not going to name her her Marcus um we need we need a female's names but uh Valerius or Aurelius or I mean yeah these are these are good um okay what about uh women's names remember the um the MC is a courtesan um so one thing that I that I noticed is that you have to sometimes remind chat GPT because it's like it'll kind of start going down its own rabbit hole and you have to pull it back and say no this is what we're doing um Let's uh let's get some women's names Julia so my fiance pointed out that um one thing that a lot of Roman homes did was that they just gave the women the feminized version so you see Julia Flavia Aurelia um so they were very super uncreative when it came to uh women's names um so we could do something like Aurelia Aurelius or Aurelia flavius I don't know um uh let's see so uh female names were often um just feminine uh versions of house names are there any other kinds of names we can choose something more distinctive Maybe foreign now this is something that I happen to know already so if you didn't know this you could have asked that question like why are why are the names weird um let's see symprio simpronia this was an uncommon given name um associated with uh sister of Cato the younger interesting tortulo sytheris or kytheris I don't know if that would be cythrus or kytheris um I want something that's not too difficult to say so Cornelia mother of the graci brothers so let's say like Cornelia flavius or something or Valerius Cornelia Valerius um would Cornelia Valerius be a legit name anything wrong with that father or husband okay in the genitive case and it would be uh valyria so I guess her name would be Cornelia valyria or Cornelia of the valyria Okay blah blah so it's telling me what's wrong with it for example it's common for Roman names to be comprised of a given name a clan name and sometimes a cognomen a nickname or additional surname that's right um um so with the given name coming first followed by the clan name followed by the cognomen good so I didn't even have to ask it realized that I was struggling um okay help me understand um what the genitive genitive case means um the Leary eye looks plural I'm lost in Latin the genitive cases used to indicate possession or ownership in English we use uh the possessive form of a noun um genitive cases often indicated by so it knows a lot about Latin um I've seen a lot of people so while it's writing I've seen a lot of people talking about how large language models don't have mental models of the world and I completely disagree this is explaining Latin to me and it not only that it intuited that I needed to learn Latin so please explain to me how it's doing this without internal models you can't trust me I have a bookcase full of Neuroscience over there okay let me do a quick time check we are at 35 minutes we'll try and wrap this up pretty quick um okay great please summarize everything up to this point um uh everything let's say uh everything about the story up to this point um you can ignore the sidebar conversations um let's go ahead and um so for example um so geniform is is for first first and second declension nouns like Valerius I don't even um I'm not going to learn that much about Latin right now but I guess I'm going to um okay here it finally explained it Cornelia valyria um so Cornelia belonging to the Valerius Clan got it let's go with this uh for now um Cornelia valyria um uh will figure out her cognomin later um yeah please go ahead and summarize our story the story is set during the height of the Roman Empire a time of great prosperity and opportunity but also a time of strict social hierarchy and rigid rules of behavior the main character is Cornelia Cornelia valyria a courtesan who was born into the powerful and Wealthy Patrician family but has fallen on hard times due to betrayal and Palace Intrigue determined to regain her family's former status and protect them from further harm she uh turns to courtesan work as a way to earn her living and support herself she climbs a social ladder through her beauty charm and witch he's able to um blah blah blah she ultimately must make a choice that takes place during the Roman or Emperor trajan she navigates the complex World okay um this is great please add the details we discussed about the fall of her family specifically that specifically they were participating in the grand public works such as the aqueducts um and that uh betrayal was over that please incorporate that into your summary and add the date as well 110 8 A.D when Cornelia was 12. um so again by asking it to restate things it kind of says okay the document is written here um and it's I confused it again um by because it says oh it's it's set in in one 1080. um uh let's see and um the story is set um a few years later as she comes into adulthood um here's an updated summary of the story the story is set in 11080 okay whatever I'm not going to fight it what I mean is like okay I could probably reword this but like this is good enough um there we go yep there we go okay I really like this as a as a backstory because it gives her a very very complex set of motivations and um let's say baggage to work through um but yeah I think we'll call this a day I'm super pleased with this um and we will uh we will be back because I love doing this um and I hope you guys enjoyed it so thanks for watching
