hey everybody David Shapiro here and I'm excited to share with you a uh a wide-ranging conversation between a bunch of Veteran uh I.T guys and software guys um so with me today thank you thank you guys so much for being here um my guests include uh Alan so Alan came up through it much like I did started with desktop support although uh I think we were on slightly different generations of desktops moved on to cyber security and now works in Cloud which is where you know kind of I ended wearing my VMware shirt rep and repping some VMware so private cloud and then also on the call we've got Tim who is a Solutions architect uh moved into managed services and and government support and Tim also was with us on the Raven project which is temporarily shuttered for now um but thanks guys for being here a little bit of background for the audiences to why I put this call together and what I hope to achieve is that uh in the conversation of AI and artificial general intelligence you know the ramp up to ever increasingly intelligent artificial intelligence one of the things that I noticed is that there's a lot of people uh talking about it they might be philosophers they might be machine learning experts they might be mathematicians but there's not a whole lot of conversation about how enterprise software actually works what it takes to deploy software and Platforms in data centers the life cycle of these things and just how complex this process is this it's an entire domain it's a huge domain so with that I wanted to get a couple of uh just a candid wide-ranging conversation together where we'll talk about software architecture development paradigms the physical infrastructure that goes into it cyber security the data then we'll also talk about Edge and iot so iot is internet of things for those that are not familiar and then the pipelines and life cycles that I mentioned that goes into developing complex software so with that uh Alan and Tim um I gave you guys a brief introduction but if you guys could uh give the audience just a little bit more flavor or context as to kind of where you've come up in terms of cloud data center Enterprise architecture that sort of stuff um Tim you want to go first yeah so thanks Dave um yeah I guess um most of my ID career has has been in managed Services um I kind of I started on help desks I knew that wasn't really for me um ended up you know working with different companies delivering Business Solutions um leveraging it as much as possible and that involved a lot of cloud migrations early on you know for the last decade or so I've been helping a lot of companies move to the cloud so that can look anywhere from you know having just a file server type situation hosted in in SharePoint online or something like that right um so a lot of the solutions I've worked on have been about productivity enablement um hosting uh different you know services in the cloud mobile device management that sort of thing um and as I progressed that sort of led me into larger scale Solutions um looking at you know Enterprise architecture so right now I'm I'm working on some low code platform adoption um analysis and architecting alongside Microsoft with um with a with a big government department so it's my careers definitely evolved um I've got a keen interest in in Ai and and how it's going to be adopted and how it's going to be managed given the complexities of it infrastructure when you've got you know um Cloud infrastructure you've got the services in the cloud you've got the pipelines to deploy Services into the cloud you've got the management of that you've got the cost management you've got people management like the it's just such a broad thing right so right yeah I'm looking forward to getting into the discussion about you know what AI looks like in the real world when it comes to iot infrastructure because it's definitely not as simple as people think and I'd be really impressed if an AI could get uh you know could Escape I promise it's the current bounds because um Good Luck to it is all I can say right yeah there's there's quite a few layers and barriers uh notwithstanding just the technical debt that a company might have in order for it to navigate um thanks thanks for that uh that flavor that background Tim that was excellent excellent contact uh context Alan yeah so I I grew up in the Before Time like when the data center had the Mainframe but your server was under your desk you know so so a lot of Novell servers if anybody remembers that but that's kind of I'm dating myself here but uh you know I walked through the process of taking that distributed compute of servers out everywhere and bringing them back into a data center kind of thing I walked I lived through that and then I got into cyber security because of this thing somebody might have heard of called Ms Blaster so that that's kind of what got me into cyber security um and then I I I sort of lived the cyber security world that transitioned to cloud like the migrations into the cloud and all that I was doing cyber security but but more from an Enterprise architecture perspective so I was dealing with some of the largest companies in the US and a few global global interests as well on these very large scale sort of cloud SAS multi-environment things uh doing cyber security um and then more recently um you know kind of transitioned into uh what what I'm going to call AI infrastructure I mean that's kind of you know infrastructure for AI workloads is kind of what I focus on uh but all along it's you know there's always been an infrastructure backend to it to what I've been doing excellent yeah no the the the connection between client server I remember I worked with uh with a guy at uh Duke Medicine who's like the cloud I've been building the cloud since the 90s Right There Was You Know Citrix and everything before before you know the cloud before the cloud was cool um you know and so yeah thanks thanks for the the context the background um yeah so let's let's get right into it uh from from your guys perspective since you're both um you know AI interested AI adjacent what are kind of the the big biggest misconceptions I guess that that you might perceive that's kind of out there in the world about how AI works or how it's deployed uh and we'll use that to kind of as a segue into talking about how infrastructure and architecture actually works you wanna go first Tim yeah look I'll I'll tackle this one for sure um I I definitely hear a lot of fear-mongering about Ai and um you know AI taking over AI escaping um from its you know container um Skynet cyberline whatever you know look we've all heard it all before um the reality is is that uh these systems uh just models right they're models running in a cloud environment that a company owns and controls and operates um and its backend is on physical Hardware um when we talk about Cloud it's you know the people in it typically just say well it's just somebody else's computer um now that's an open a simplification of course but uh when it comes to what AI is running on it is somebody else's computer or a data center of computers that it's that it's operating under so when you think about the um just the layers involved in that so you've got a physical layer you've got a software layer and then you've got all the real world layers that get wrapped around that thing you know which companies are actually running the hardware which companies are running the cloud which companies are owning the IP of the AI model and all of those cost a lot of money as well so you know these Services Don't just run for free they're not um they're not afraid for all so uh thinking through that context right it's How could an AI model actually autonomously escaped from its current cloud environment and to me the answer is I don't know how that's possible you know it would need to sign up to a new cloud service it would need to provision all the services that support the actual running of the model it would need to convince a whole bunch of people to actually you know support the environment and potentially plug some cables into to different places on the network um it's it's got to be able to map out all the routes and network connectivity that it needs to to get to the internet and to you know navigate through different internal systems it's really complex so I'll leave it with that Alan did you want to jump in yeah I think you know when you think about the the sort of application architecture layer like like these apps themselves in a lot of cases are are defined by a container right like the the actual thing that that you're interacting with when you interact with something like chat GPT or Bard you're you're talking to an API endpoint of some sort that's being served by a container getting the container to move around places is probably not that hard of the of the things that that the AGI would want to do but if you're going to take it out of its native environment so it's deployed to cloud provider a and it decides oh well it's all secure here but I found a weakness somewhere else actually making sure that container is as greatest containers are for for you know it works everywhere the problem with the AI models themselves is they do need specialized Hardware to run in a performant manner and so if you're not landing on Hardware in this other environment that that's got the right you know right type of gpus doesn't have the right memory bandwidth doesn't have the right performance factors all of a sudden it's just going to fail like like I think I think there's as much challenge for the AGI replicating itself around say dependency tracking and making sure in these other environments it's got everything it needs um you know like kind of like a human going to a completely different environment right if if you're a human and you move to a completely different um culture and state what you're used to doesn't work well agi's got the same problems right yeah so to to kind of restate that uh for a broader audience there's not all data centers are created equal and not all the hardware that's in those data centers is created equal the the networking the Ingress and egress uh in and out of those data centers because I think one one misconception is that a lot of people you know that's like oh well I can interact with chat GPT really easily and I can you know uh call up any number of apis but an API is like just using you know calling someone over the phone right you're not actually getting the person the telepresence is not fully like you know metastasizing from one environment to another uh and even if the AGI model could transmit itself there's going to be a lot more dressing around that there's the hardware that it's dependent upon there's the the rest of the software architecture needed to run uh that entire thing and but then of course there's uh security and monitoring if you have a container that is not registered or not identified that starts running on your Hardware in your Cloud infrastructure you're probably going to see that and investigate that so there's a lot of vectors there that can prevent something from spreading and moving around um great uh great uh conversation opening um from here I guess one thing that that uh that I see out there is that you know there's sometimes magical thinking around you know oh well once it's AGI it's going to be able to breach any security barrier it's basically going to be able to go wherever it wants do whatever it wants take over anything uh which may be possible in certain circumstances you know we're moving more uh compute resources to the edge you know we've got internet of things we're deploying gpus pretty much everywhere but the relative horsepower available in you know a back office server versus you know a five kilowatt rack is going to be very very different and so uh basically the the there's a lot of layers that it has to get through which we which we mentioned earlier um from the from the perspective of those dependencies because that's something that we've talked about a couple times there's software dependencies there's Hardware dependencies there's Network dependencies so there's all kinds of dependencies so can we unpack that a little bit just like for any whether it's an AI or not but any software platform uh there's going to be a tremendous amount of dependencies and I Tim I think uh I think it might make sense for you to leave this one off since you've done Cloud migration so what all goes into a cloud migration to move from one Cloud to another or on-prem to Cloud because I think that this will be really really Illuminating for a lot of people just to understand how much effort goes into forklifting stuff from one place to another yeah great that's a that's a good question um I guess it it you know always depends on the use case um but if we're say uh I could probably give you an example of say like a a not-for-profit organization 500 people um they currently have internal monolithic architecture and by monolithic I mean it's you know physical infrastructure there's not a lot of cloud migration there's I'm sorry there's no Cloud integration um and typically each function of it in terms of its services has its own server so you would have a file server you'd have a print server you've got a domain controller which controls all your identities and access to the network um you might have a database server that runs one or several of your applications you've got web servers you've got firewalls proxy servers you know I could go on and on right so um moving to the cloud is about consolidating all of those different internal services and replicating them in the cloud and typically what you want to see is larger Network pipes more stable internet connection because once you start depending on externally hosted Services you've got a single point of failure in your connectivity there um so in terms of moving it we need to capture all of the ways that the business uses their I.T in most cases this is not well documented it typically lives inside one person's head or or a team of people's heads those that support the the infrastructure um and then there's a lot of times spent mapping out the pathway for the migration so that might mean that you know we stand up a cloud tenant and um connect their active directory to you know for example if we're using Microsoft Azure we'd we'd use a zero active directory and synchronize their identity to the cloud and then we would look at moving their file system into something like teams or SharePoint you know some sort of productivity Suite um uh you know Google Apps is one of those as well no don't leave Google out here and uh and then it's about you know figuring out which this is going to depend on certain information and the timeline of switching that information from being accessible locally to the new Cloud platform we've got to train people on how to use a new system um you know we've got to coordinate with all the business stakeholders in terms of when is the best time of the year sometimes in some cases to to do this sort of work because businesses you know their workflow Ebbs and flows particularly if you're looking at something like Financial Services you know end of financial year is a really busy time so you avoid those sorts of things um yeah look I could go on all day about this obviously but yeah as you can tell it's it's it's complex right it's complex so there's a lot of things to consider um I barely scratch the surface in terms of dependencies right yeah so the point point being is that whenever you have any complex uh technology stack um whatever whatever the business function is there's a lot that goes into it the all the various Services the interdependencies that it requires the data the hardware the code and then if you add another layer of complexity on top of that the models that AI runs because it's probably not going to just be one model in the future either and we're going to have numerous models so you know you can imagine migrating a 700 gigabyte model you'd probably notice that saturating your pipes between data centers uh before it was able to copy itself and not to mention that they're probably going to get bigger and there's going to be more of them um Alan from yeah go ahead oh that was um there's a software architecture to consider as well do you want to speak about Allen I'm going to talk a little bit here just about this dependency thing and it's really at the software level is is kind of where where my head was because I think one of the things that's a little different maybe because we we haven't seen AGI yet right there's a lot of people that might make claims but we we don't believe we have that yet but one of the things I I've been thinking about from sort of the software Hardware independent like like the interdependencies is ATI is going to have to retrain itself on an ongoing basis like like based on the way we do things it can't be basically serving itself all the time you know accepting inputs doing things it's going to have to be retraining and and it's kind of like humans in the sense of it probably has to go to sleep or something for a while to retrain itself every day but if you think about that right now from an application perspective the the code and what's being done to train it is very different than the code that's being done to serve it like like those those you know the the code for training sits in in notebooks and is kind of you know this kind of esoteric thing that the the sort of wizards of AI get to play with and then you've got the actual serving code that is typically you know encapsulated in a container that's deployed at scale and it's it and so those two those two pieces of the the application actually have to come together and move around for the for this AGI to be be able to move to another place right and so you've got both sort of this dependency at the training layer of code of what that looks like and and what it's needed to be training which you know especially for a very large model you're you're talking about code that's got to be able to span multiple gpus usually like possibly tens or hundreds or thousands to do that training um and so just making sure there's even capacity wherever it it copies itself to to do that is one bit of the challenge the other side of it is even if that retraining can be done small right like like apis we've we've developed these algorithms that the retraining is really small it's not a huge thing there's a lot of data to it typically the actual sort of memory footprint of your gpus and how the gpus operate are very different between training and serving that actually you typically need a lot more memory and and bandwidth in your training gpus than you do in your serving gpus and so I think just you know the AGI Landing itself in that right heterogeneous environment to do you know retrain itself in real time I I think it's just gonna be really hard like like it you're going to end up with these Dual Purpose um aspects and then to a certain extent like the human brains made up that way right there's parts of your brain that do some access other parts of brain do other things I think AGI is going to need that that dual Hardware environment to be able to even function yeah absolutely um the the human feedback aspect to it you know the the models we have now that um the most impressive all involve some level of of human feedback in their training to some degree or they were trained on chat gbt model which gives human feedback anyway so that's another thing that you know if I guess if if humans are taken out of the equation is AI is an AI model able to retrain itself without that input you know is it just gonna completely hallucinate and go off the rails without some external input guiding it yeah on that one I just I just skimmed a paper about that where basically they've shown that if you retrain uh your AIS Onsen too much synthetic data they go insane yep they call it model collapse uh where it just it becomes it becomes dumber and dumber and less connected to reality because it's kind of in its own Echo chamber and it's talking to itself for too long yeah so there so there's a couple go ahead sorry the humans experienced that too they're nice for Life yeah you know if you get someone who's been isolated for X number of years um typically they're not functioning very well um and then have a period of time to reintegrate into society because they've got a their brain's gotta be able to handle all that external input again yep yeah so this you know this conversation kind of so far has already reinforced the idea of like okay if we do need to regulate or prevent you know AI from escaping you can probably just regulate the the relatively few data centers that are there that have the correct Hardware uh but then again it's it's within every company's best interest to make sure that they you know gate keep what's coming in and out of their data centers anyways regardless of what the AI models are doing now that being said there is one major confounding variable here and that is that a lot of these models have direct access to the public so I don't know if you guys heard but in one of the one of the tests I think it was Microsoft internal research did with gpt4 the original model they basically tasked it with manipulating the outside world and it went and hired you know a contractor to do X Y and Z and so one possibility one possible counter argument I guess is you could say well it doesn't even have to escape the lab in order to uh in order to do harm or damage as long as it can you know make a few really tactical calls um so what do you guys think about uh from that perspective you know kind of gatekeeping the the flow of information in or out or monitoring the apis or that sort of thing do you have any um any direction to go on on that uh in terms of from a maybe a cyber security perspective Allen do you have any thoughts yeah so I think the reality of it is that kind of external communication from the AI definitely needs you know things like anomaly detection or maybe AI layered on top of it like at the end of the day um I I was pretty impressed with the whole taskrabbit that article you're talking about where where um it talked to human and into it by lying basically it said uh the human actually asked are you actually a robot in the and the bot came back and said hey uh no I just visually impaired right so so there's definitely got to be you know sort of anomaly detection or other things on the egress which is which in in most Enterprise use cases is is an activity that's going on like they're doing that watching for data X fill so I feel like there's a lot of opportunity just to leverage existing um security practices to monitor what's going on what's Happening who who is this this engaging with but it is definitely a a challenge or a threat to that the allowing the AI to be an actor on your behalf I think you're you're are more likely to see people you know humans sort of that are Gatekeepers of this sort of enabling it for their own purpose that that is to say hey I want to do this thing that might be sketchy based on corporate you know uh rules but I'll have the AI do it so I have plausible deniability I think that's going to be a lot more likely initial misuse of the AI or that kind of thing of people actually directing it to do the wrong thing at first more than the AI deciding to do the wrong thing and then that's going to turn into you know it it might not be that much different than than a human just running you know Powershell or python or something to do the wrong thing other than they've they've super powered what they're doing wrong with the AGI right and I don't know about you guys but I've been on Plenty of Late Night Calls where someone wrote a firewall script that that barfed and you know killed all the firewall rules and were up late until they were able to restore it so you know the my point there is that if the AGI makes one mistake during its own you know gamification or X-File or whatever it could end up Walling itself off or effectively lobotomizing itself uh on accident without some kind of uh like you've mentioned before like some some kind of supervisor um Tim you mentioned uh mobile device management MDM so I want to Pivot and talk about that for a minute because this was this is mobile devices this is Edge so another possibility is that uh you know there might be decentralized agents right where there's many many agents or nodes maybe operating on a blockchain or a federation uh kind of uh software Paradigm so it that that is a possible uh software architecture that could be outside of the uh of the data center but that of course introduces all kinds of new complexity so could you give us a little bit of flavor background like what does it take to have you know a decentralized Federation of servers Edge iot or mobile devices yeah look how I'll give it my best shot um it's uh again there's there's a lot of moving Parts in in um in that sort of infrastructure um mostly it's it's either you could consider it like a microservices and or um mind control type setup you've got your central platform that um all your devices would report into but then there's the infrastructure that supports all those devices as well so when we're talking mobile usually that's some sort of GSM you know they have SIM card in it or they have Wi-Fi connectivity or something like that um that's not typically owned by the operator of the mobile device management platform so you have third parties involved in that sort of infrastructure as well um when it comes to connectivity you know if it's a private or Enterprise type setups you you might have um it might be its own private Network that uses public infrastructure to achieve that that requires its own special configuration with a service provider whether that be internet service provider or telecommunications in general um and then on each device it would have a piece of software whether that's an app or a service built into the operating system that will communicate back and forth between the the device management platform um to get its commands or or report back whatever Telemetry um it's responsible for detecting and Reporting on so yeah many many layers of of complexity to to manage a fleet of mobile devices and you know given given the size of models today granted some of them are getting smaller and at the same time mobile processing power is going up but that's still absolutely pales in comparison to the uh capacity of of comp or the compute capacity inside of data centers um yeah there's a lot of um disparity between mobile devices in general if we're talking about handheld mobile phones um you might have someone who's who's still got a phone that's 10 years old which I quite happy to use and keep a hold of whereas you know and that's not something AI would be able to leverage if it was if let's say we're talking about a situation where it's installing itself or running on on different devices you've got to have the Modern Hardware to support that sort of thing yeah yeah absolutely Alan you have uh any anything to add to the like the mobile or Edge aspect of it so I think there's two pieces this I'll talk about just mobile human devices versus iot device I'll discriminate that a little bit so I think the big thing on the mobile human devices if we're trying to sort of protect ourselves from AGI is really the the more Global General implementation of human president human presence indicators so it's the idea that basically if you're going to authenticate the way you defeat an AGI authenticating on your behalf is you have to be the one that you know there's a human presence there's a thumb a live thumbprint there's you know touching a something to to cause it to decrypt things like that things that that sort of say that yes there's actually a physical person here um and that's I think that's tricky for the AGI to fake basically doesn't mean it can't but just to say the way apps Are Walled off and the way the security measures and the devices are today even that human presence indicator is actually pretty good and I think we're gonna see actual inhuman in in-person human proofing and the instantiation of devices that you just have a thing that you got at your bank or the DMV or somewhere that really says you're a human that you have to activate it when you do things and that also then cryptographically secure stuff that's going to just happen like to deal with the distributed sort of AI doing things that's behaving like humans I think I think that technology just has to happen on the other side I think the big problem on for the the iot devices is just Hardware like most distributed iot devices are made with the bare minimal Hardware possible to do the job they were designed for and so yes you might be able you know AGI might be able to crack my my webcam that I'm using in my security system in my home but there's probably not that much power or you know compute to it to be useful for it and so I think that's that's going to be the limiting factor there in a lot of the iot scenarios is just that device was already so limited in its functionality there's not a lot it can do it could be acted on by an AGI but it can't the AGI is not going to like suddenly take it over and start you know doing interesting things with it because there's just not enough power there right it doesn't it doesn't have the horsepower it doesn't have the legs to do anything particularly fascinating or interesting um or or dangerous more specifically but what you talk about the the you know the the hardware that's already built into uh mobile phones and and can be easily integrated into other uh things where it's like there's there's actually multiple uh Dimensions multiple bits of data that that show hey this device is actually being held by a real human there's the internal gyroscope there's the there's the proximity sensors the uh the capacitive uh what is it like um the electrostatic capacitive like field they can actually detect if there's a if there's a living body nearby yeah there's all kinds of sensors that are built into these and that and that that is that as at a security level is actually integrated into the kernel of those operating systems is that uh correct interpretation yeah I mean there are in in the actual Hardware there are bits of of cryptographic security chips and various things depending on the Vendor model like what's in it that are sort of locked at the factory or otherwise you know secure enough that's very unlikely that the the AGI is going to be able to to basically manipulate that because it sits below where the actual AGI operates which is in the software layer so right not to say it's impossible but for the most part those things and and I suspect over time there will even be sort of a separation of concerns so to speak where where within the actual Hardware itself there's sort of a disconnected part that's handling that human detection bit and then once you've passed the human detection bit then you can get into the into the rest of it and that'll be taken out of band so so that essentially if you it requires an input you got to prove you're really a human holding it as opposed to it you know just being automatic on the device right yep and and you know on the on the infrastructure side on the data center side what a lot of people don't realize is that there are out of band management and monitoring uh uh components of servers basically every server has an out of band uh set of connections that allows you to remotely monitor the server shut it down there's also Technologies uh like for instance called secure boot uh meaning that you can you can prove uh cryptographically whether or not the operating system has been modified from what it's supposed to be at a hardware level and then of course there's things that like at rest encryption so there's there's many many layers of security here that can prevent um I mean really these were all designed to prevent human actors right viruses and and and human mistakes from modifying these things but a lot of these security features are going to play forward and they would that that is something that AGI would also have to overcome uh you know so there's there's plenty of existing layers in in cyber security yeah well and you're just speaking my language I spent but when I mentioned to you earlier I did I was part of the cyber security practice for a bit that I built up and it was all about that level of security of you know secure boot for you know identity systems and cryptography systems to be able to prove that they had never been you know touched outside of like spent weeks at a time in in air-gapped rooms Building Systems and things like that and so you know these major data centers whether they're Cloud providers government whatever they're doing that kind of thing where systems you know key cryptography or identity systems were actually built in a vault and you know the the operations of them are managed in a way that that's so offline it would be not impossible but you would have to manipulate Some Humans along the way to be able to do something different than you're doing now yeah you know that actually reminds me of something I had a few people ask me about uh neuromorphic chips so uh for for anyone in the audience who's not familiar a neuromorphic chip is basically an analog chip that that is running a a fixed a static neural network on the chip device uh these are typically used for mobile purposes because uh you can't you can't retrain them and you can't redeploy them but they can they they can be you know 10 times faster 10 times cheaper and use a hundred times less energy uh because it's running at the hardware level rather than the software level and so this is this is pure speculation but what I suspect is that over time because right now we're in a very high velocity phase where there's new models coming out every week right but before too long it'll be worthwhile to say hey we've got this model you know whether it's a vision model or a language model or a multimodal model that you know it's it's stable it's viable let's go ahead and create a chip version an Asic version or a neuromorphic chip that's going to be static and so then the model can't even change itself it's entirely possible that some of this is it's not going to even be a matter of defeating it from a software security perspective it's going to be fixed or static and so some of that is what you're talking about like the the actual board level Hardware is not really changeable and I suspect that AI is going to have some of that as well uh what do you what do you think about that idea oh I I was hoping we'd get here to the neuromorphic chips because I find that whole thing fascinating um and and part of the reason I find it fascinating is just the power thing right I I think the the the actual biggest limiter to AI dominance of the world right now is actually physical power like at the end of the day there's just a huge amount of of power necessary to do the training they needed to do the serving because these are very power hungry chips on the other hand the neuromorphic chips are so low power it's amazing and so so you know I when we think AGI I think a lot of people fall into this default of like Skynet you know from from the Terminator series or if you've seen the the iRobot movie that you know big brain in the sky taking over everything but I but I would also argue that something with sort of the intelligence of a cat or a dog would also be AGI it's it's retrainable it does things and so I think we're going to end up with some Edge really interesting edge cases with very limited sort of almost instinctual things they do you know like like when a horse is born it knows how to stand up like humans it takes a long time for us but horses know that well that's what's going to be on these analog tips you're talking about we have a lot of edge devices and a lot of things on the edge that have these fully trained this part's always static but then augmented by something that has some dynamicism that makes it you know smart but not as you know fully intelligent as a human sure sure yeah and and so like you know taking that to a a more logical extreme I can Envision a future where there are neuromorphic chips embedded in everything whether it's servers firewalls uh home security devices and because it's set at the hardware level you can't hack it it's not something you can even delete it's just an intrinsic function of the device but because they require a lot less energy and they can often run many times faster they could run circles around the the you know the software version of the model even though the software version might be bigger it might have more up-to-date data but because it's because it is intrinsically more power hungry it's going to be at a at a competitive disadvantage I remember I got the I kind of realized this was the way that it was coming when I first learned about more neuromorphic chips and then I went and watched the new Star Wars movies and I was like oh right you know when you just plug in a Droid brain and it's a piece of Hardware that's how it's going to be it's it's going to be a physical you know neural network that you plug into you know your your home device or your robot pet or whatever and that's going to be fixed it's not going to be something that's going to be changeable but it also makes it more intrinsically secure because you can't you know you can't like copy the neuromorphic chip over the Internet it's physically there it's it's it is it is as embodied as your brain is which leads to all sorts of other uh interesting you know ethical or or economic perspectives uh Tim you have any any anything you want to chime in on the uh the hardware level we're kind of nerding out over yeah the neuromorphic chips uh but feel free to add in or take it another direction if anything's resonating I I think it's a really cool concept and um I can I guess I can see how once a model you know once they figure out what the models um I guess parameter weights are how that could be potentially replicated at the physical layer um I love altered carbon uh that that um book slash Netflix series um and it's like uh the you know the discs that they have with their DNA it could uh it could be maybe the the weights of of the different neural Pathways which make up someone's personality um although just the thought that came to me I thought I think it's fascinating um but yeah technology wise look I don't know it's all very cool I don't have any experience in that space But it's um yeah I can't wait to see what the future holds I I think I think I think humanoid robots are definitely on the cards in that way and having some sort of physical um brain structure rather than it be implemented in software for the reasons that you've been mentioning power yeah yeah yeah and so that you you know we some some of the videos that I've I've talked about I've talked about different form factors that AGI could come in you know whether it's the physically embodied you know like the the robots from iRobot or commander data or whatever where it's a it's an intrinsically kind of self-contained system that is mostly Hardware or at least constrained to that piece of Hardware um you know then the most extreme example uh this is closer to what um what Ben gertzel is working on which is something that is intrinsically distributed uh you know and we mentioned that earlier I guess one one concern that that people might have uh and I don't know how serious of a concern it is but the idea of like viruses and botnets because you know like stuxnet uh configure and and all the like really really bad um malware and and spyware that has existed has has been out there so what do you guys what do you guys think about the idea of that of maybe part of AGI is going to be something that is just highly decentralized um you know running a tiny model on every device that it can hack and whatever and then it has this kind of swarm intelligence is there any possibility that you see of that happening or you know or existing security paradigms and Hardware paradigms enough to kind of Tamp that down because again like one thing that I think of is there's people trying to do this already what's the difference right you know whether it's a hostile foreign actor or you know corporate uh industrial Espionage all this kind of stuff is already happening and it's not like AGI is going to have a fundamentally different set of tools right it can it can try and hack the same way that any human can so what do you guys what do you guys think of of that idea like AGI as a virus yeah I think it's I think that's probably more of a realistic concern um in the short term um given that we already face these things with existing botnets um and I think it's plausible that they get all augmented by AI to become more powerful um you know the the auto GPT um project that that came out this year I think demonstrates what that might look like um with autonomous agents potentially being spawned by an Nai system or or botnet with its own intentions you know and that not necessarily A Time with its prescribed intentions from whatever bad actor that I've been on the receiving end of this before I've run websites for various social groups and have seen them be overrun by by Bots um to the point where I just got out of the game altogether because it was they became too powerful um for for my level of expenditure so um and that's the other thing there's a real cost associated with protecting yourself against that sort of stuff um at the moment you know with with distributed denial of service attack protection most major websites use services like cloudflare to protect against that sort of thing because they have the bandwidths they have the the routing uh there to redirect traffic when they need to right so yeah look I I think it's uh I think it's a real concern and something matters probably going to happen sooner rather than later interesting okay yeah no I I definitely hear you there uh because again like you know DDOS attacks happen all the time uh you know distributed botnets even even stealing data right exfiltration or or infiltration um Alan do you have a have thoughts about the that kind of more decentralized virus agis virus kind of model of thinking I I think the tricky part for me in all of that is motive okay so so having done as much um cyber as I have there's sort of this hierarchy of needs of of hackers so to speak from just someone trying it for fun because they wanted to show they can do a thing to governments doing you know intentional Espionage damage whatever I think one of the challenges is for AGI as an independent agent right just as as a thing that that realizes today hey I'm I can do things I think you're gonna see that sort of actual script Kitty like I'm just trying something because I can because otherwise I don't know what its motivation is right I don't know what it's motivated to go broader on the other hand if the AGI is somehow being influenced by a human actor or some maybe not a human actor but a corporate actor right whether that Corp is a corporation or the government in some way that it's got a design parameter that has a an outcome at once I can see that you know there's there's lots of um uh scenarios of of having bad um uh basically bad objective functions for your AI like there's a lot of thought experiments around that and so you know the thought experiment that says well if you tell it to optimize making stamps it will you know cut down all the force in the world to make as many stamps as possible like that that kind of AGI deciding to botnet itself to go do something because it was given an otherwise benign thing I could see that kind of mistake happening and and to your point it it will be this kind of mild distributed thing I think the the real point though is for it to do other than sort of incidental damage like a DDOS attack or you know like say a mass uh crypto thing where it's it's locked people out of files it's got to be it's got to have room to be a big model that can do a lot of dynamic stuff right so I think that's the tricky part we talked about dependencies kind of coming back to the beginning where we talked about dependencies we talked about that I mean for these kind of bots to run right now the dependencies the the gpus and not everything has it so and even even in in most important Data Systems don't necessarily have gpus right now um because that's not what they're that's not what they process that's not how they handle it so I think I think that I I do agree with that the idea that it will be kind of a swarm effect but I think it'll be really interesting to see what was the agi's motivation to get started on this right yeah yeah okay and that's the big question right one one one hypothesis one Theory out there is uh instrumental convergence that whatever goal you give it you know if it's even if it's just managing the energy grid right and you say hey here's here's a decentralized AGI that the department of energy deployed and it's there to manage the energy grid well if you don't supervise it it might decide to try and take over all energy sources across the whole plant something like that but one thing that that really strikes me that's missing from from those hypotheses those those kind of constructs is the idea that like okay yes you might have one powerful AGI out there that is built for defense or Espionage or whatever but then there's going to be a million more for a variety of other purposes and even even some adversarial to defend against that uh so you know the in in the in the arms race of cyber security of hacking uh like this is the of course this is nothing new humans have been competing against each other for since the invention of the network what was the story do you guys know the story that I'm thinking of where it's like the the very first web server like someone like the first hacker of all time just like oh hey you have no security here so I like modified this file and they're like oh I guess we need a security layer right I think that was probably at CERN in the 1989 or whatever but you know like we kind of figured out that you need security uh by virtue of either accidents happening or people just seeing what they can do so that part is nothing new looks like Tim had to step away for just a moment um but yeah so you know let's see we're uh at about oh we're already at 50 minutes time flies um but yeah so I'm back yeah thanks Tim um yeah we wanna we we're we're almost uh closing in on an hour so I just want to open it up and are there any topics that I that we didn't cover or any any pet theories or personal topics that you guys want to bring up um before we start to wind down oh sorry I was just gonna say before on the other point that um I I think it's more likely that bad actors will use that sort of you know botnap Style attack Style rather than a b an autonomous AGI you know if you know what I mean um because it's an existing model right we we hear of um governments countries Melissa groups all that sort of stuff they all are using technology to their advantage these days yeah that's where I think the roots comes from there but um yeah did you want to expand on that anymore or we could put that to rest yeah yeah no what we can do is um maybe maybe I ask the question not the best way like what what is what is personal to you about artificial intelligence what what do you want to see and what do you want to help achieve uh with respect to artificial intelligence or conversely what are you afraid of if there is anything that you're afraid of uh you can hit either or both of those if you'd like yeah personally um I've really see a huge benefit for a couple of things one is education um and secondly it's uh assistance so you know people with disabilities whether it be physical neurological whatever um I think you're going to get a huge Advantage from AI systems in the future um whether that be like a personal assistant or just through Better Health Care um you know but we're already seeing gbd4 models produce better outcomes than human doctors so that's something that really excites me personally um just because of my own experience in life and and having some chronic health conditions um I think that's really huge and then the education piece within some really impressive stuff coming out of town Academy and being in the education sector at the moment myself uh there's huge opportunities particularly in public education for um just more resources in the classroom and I think AI can definitely help with that you know imagine if every teacher just has an AI assistant alone that's one concept is going to be a game changer so I'm very much invested in seeing that kind of person excellent excellent thanks thanks Tim um Alan same question what do you what do you hope to see or what are you afraid of either or both so so I'll just Echo Tim's thing on the on the hope to see like I I saw the Khan Academy like there's a great YouTube on what they're doing and and there's this curve about education that if you if you can give personalized education to a student you everybody gets helped so I thought I think that's great like the vision he casts there and and what's going to happen with that I think that's that's amazing and it's going to have a huge impact on on the world uh but what I'm afraid of is a little creepy actually it's it's this other thing we haven't talked about yet from a hardware perspective so to speak of organoid computing so I don't know if you've seen this before but organized competing is the idea of taking stem cells and growing effectively brain cells that do the same kind of neural networks you know like that's the model right um and apparently I don't know if this is true or not because I saw this in passing but apparently they took a couple of these organoid you know these piles of brain cells in a Petri dish and put them against each other playing pong now I don't know if that's true or not but that by itself is just super creepy you know you've got kind of like the brain that ate New York kind of creepy thing that's creeping me out but then the same day I heard there's this new like AI has invented a a protein replacement so the the molecule that we have that's that we ingest is protein in our body that makes up muscle cells and things like that apparently there's there's some compound that AI has figured out that gives gives that's more heat resistant and has longer longevity and all this stuff like if you basically replace proteins with this it's better so the thing that scares me is if the organoid Computing then sucks up these weird brain chemicals or these these weird proteins it'll become the indestructible uh bringing the date New York and then we're just out then AGI wins yeah that I I I'm familiar with some of the some of the research you're talking about there where you know people growing um I think they started with mouse brains and rap brains but I I did see like in the last week they they did they cloned human brain cells and I think one that that's just a horrible idea and and even possibly even just unethical um because if you grow something in a Petri dish and you zap it until it does what you want like you're just creating a tiny entity that's you can torture basically to until it learns to do what you want it to um but but the the conclusion I'm laughing but it is a very creepy and and uh and and apocryphal uh possibility of you know let's be let's be careful with uh with what we do with these things um so but yeah thanks guys for jumping on the call and sharing your your experience and wisdom and insight um it's been a great talk and and like I said time flies um so yeah thanks thanks again uh and and for the audience out there I hope you got a lot out of of this realize that you know AGI whether or not it comes uh you know today next year 10 years from now there's going to be a lot of layers of complexity and Security in place that's going to make it so that we can manage this thing uh regardless of how it looks and and there's a lot of a lot of steps between now and then uh you know the escaping the lab is is pretty low on uh on the radar right now it seems like so anyways thanks for watching I hope everyone got a lot out of it cheers
