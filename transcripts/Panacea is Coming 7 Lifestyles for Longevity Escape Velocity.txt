hey everybody David Shapiro here with a video so today's video is going to be about longevity longevity escape velocity and more specifically how we're going to live when we live forever so welcome to longevity Lifestyles now before we get started I need to give you a little bit of context what are the assumptions that I'm making and what are the trends that I'm paying attention to so first and foremost the primary prediction is that Panacea is coming and there's three primary trends that I'm paying attention to when I make this assertion first AI drug Discovery if you watch my recent video about orphan drugs and the FDA approving the first uh AI generated orphan drug for rare diseases uh it granted it's not fully approved but it is in Phase 2 clinical trials so basically this is a sign of the ramp up to AI discovering all drugs for all diseases now that's obviously prediction it's not guaranteed it's not a foregone conclusion but it is a step in the right direction number two is Rejuvenation therapies uh some of the biggest universities in the world uh Harvard MIT and a few others have been releasing papers uh recently about uh whole body Rejuvenation cellular Rejuvenation uh uh chemical cocktails and these are things that do not require genetic engineering these are just medicines that can be taken sometimes orally um and in other cases via injection or other uh uh vectors of administration that uh create Rejuvenation basically Bally a f a legitimate real life Fountain of Youth and this is not just on Mouse models some of these are on human models meaning that we are very very close to having general purpose medicines that uh one are cheap and easy and accessible that also promise to move us closer to uh indefinite lifespan and then finally uh number three is using AI in the sensing detection prevention and modeling of diseases uh an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and so if you can detect and prevent the disease you've probably seen some of the trends out there uh lately of AI being able to predict uh you know Alzheimer's you know several decades in advance being able to calculate exactly like where where the cancer is or what's wrong with your brain just by with a you know a few drops of blood that sort of stuff so these three Trends combined uh between AI drug Discovery Rejuvenation therapies and then finally the the sensing deduction prevention and modeling of diseases this is what I mean when I say Panacea is coming and P and AI is the medical Panacea okay so with that assumption with that with those Trends and extrapolations in mind here's what I predict is going to happen to set the stage for longevity Lifestyles number one indefinite lifespan we are ramping up to longevity escape velocity some people have asked me if we're already there and I kind of think that we are because when you look at uh the definition of longevity escape velocity it is that for every year of life you gain more than a year of life expectancy now as some people have pointed out right now particularly because of the pandemic and depression and and other other reasons um life expectancy has not uh increased as particularly for young people and it's actually still going down so technically it might be a little while before we feel the effects but with compounding returns and acceleration of AI I suspect that within 5 to 10 years we will definitely have really concrete data about longevity escape velocity and honestly within 10 years I suspect uh everyone's going to be like look back at this video and be like wow Dave that was really quaint this like this either aged really well or I like completely I I like undersold and underpredicted how much it's going to be so we'll see uh time will tell number two post- labor economics so this is something that I'm constantly talking about basically as AI ramps up and it gets better at solving things like medical issues and disease prevention that those improvements are going to be commensurate with other improvements uh which are basically just going to invalidate the need for human Labor uh and so then part of the longevity Lifestyles is going to be let's combine longevity with post labor and let's see how we're going to live uh number three I think that hospitals are going to collapse um most diseases uh particularly in affluent uh industrialized nations are age related uh you know I don't know about you but like from from the time that I was born the next time that I went to the hospital was in my 30s so I went like more than three decades without going to the hospital uh and if everyone is like locked into you know a 22 year old body or 25y old body that level of health and vigor most people might never need to go to the hospital except and unless they get into like a car accident or to give birth um and because of that I think that hospitals as a business model are just going to go away uh and so I I suspect that the few hospitals that remain are basically going to be government services just because the margins are going to be too thin and it won't make sense now what we might do is uh subsidize Private Industry because you know we're in the free market theory and so rather than the government providing the service it might just be that the government writes a check so that the business is profitable not sure uh number four and I think that uh if you look at Reddit and the subreddit r/ Suburban hell um I think this is probably the best news for everyone is that suburbs are going to collapse and so the reason is as people live longer uh we're going to have fewer children because what's the rush uh we're going to have different Lifestyles but also with post- labor economics uh suburbs are really optimized for being close to the city where the jobs are but if you're not working in the city then you don't need to be close to the city you don't need to be within commuting distance and also they're optimized for uh single family homes and if you're not having children you don't need to live in the suburbs so I suspect that suburbs are going to go the way the Dinos and we will look back uh maybe not so fondly on that period of American history and say wow suburbs were a terrible idea I'm glad that died a quick death again this might age poorly we'll see okay now that the stage has been set let's talk about longevity Lifestyles all right so number one Urban socialites so Urban socialites are the people that want to live in the cities and stay in the cities forever uh basically imagine that you've got a 25-year-old body and you just want to live it up day in day out you want to go to con you want to go to Raves you want to go clubs I remember there was a there was a I went out on a date with a woman and like you know went dancing or whatever I'm a terrible dancer so like didn't do that again but uh you know I I went back to her place to you know meet her roommate and stuff and she's like yeah whatever I'm not interested in in anything you know getting tied down cuz I'm young and hot and I was just like that is when I made this slide I was like that's who I was thinking of was that girl and her roommate that were just like We're Young we're living it up we're going to enjoy the time while our you know bodies are at our Peak attractiveness and that sort of thing so this is like fast-paced life it's all about experiences it's all about getting out there and meeting a lot of people now I'm not saying that people are going to be Urban socialites forever but rather than just doing it in your 20s you might be able to do it for several decades number two rural Hermits so this is more my speed I am a hobbit um these are people who just want to DeCamp to the countryside to you know smoke their pipeweed and read books and eat good food maybe have a garden and Brew some ale basically live like Bilbo or froto uh their ideal life out in the countryside uh now there's a there's a bunch of different ways obviously not everyone's going to you know you wear a waste coat and read uh old Victorian books some people might do it for Spiritual reasons um some people might do homesteading or whatever but the idea is that uh proximity to Nature qu peace and quiet uh Solitude that sort of thing minimalism uh could be another reason that people want to DeCamp to the countryside side number three so a slightly alternative model for the countryside is social communes so obviously urban life is not everyone's speed that's not my speed um so this is probably closer to what I would want to do where rather than grouping together for work because that's why we cluster around cities uh right now today at least uh some people cluster in cities for social reasons but by and large cities are there because they are a a Nexus a hub of work um and also social hubs but imagine that you want community life but not in the urban dense Urban environment America and a lot of other places have a lot of open space and so because of the the high cost of cities I suspect that particularly as post- labor economics ramps up and people need stuff to do I think that like small towns and you know like plann neighborhoods out in the countryside are just going to be a thing so whether or not it's a full-on commune or at least just a small planned community that is very Community Centric um I think that this is just going to be a thing and I I actually predict that like a lot of people are going to live like this where it's just like oh hey here's a little town it's a cluster of 100 houses and everything is focused on uh creating community centers because people aren't going to be working so you're going to be in your house you're going to get bored and we're just going to plan small towns and Villages around social life uh the next one Globe trotting Adventures so there's a lot of people who do this today and aspire to do this so this is like what you know the influencer trend and a lot of YouTubers there are so many people out there that like this is the life that they aspire to where they just want to travel they want to you know document their experiences they want to become an influencer they want to become a YouTuber uh or Tik Tok as the young people use today uh Instagram that sort of thing and so but imagine that you're going to be young forever and you don't need to work because we have post- labor economics you don't need a social media following to do this you just go do it and you do it for the sake of uh the Venture from you know if you want to go you know Climb Every Mountain or you want to you know visit uh every city in Greece or whatever it is that you want to do um you know I have friends that have been to uh Vietnam Cambodia China uh one of one of my friends back in the day he just like gets a plane ticket goes somewhere with no plan and he ended up like like on a fishing barge like going up the river in Vietnam and all he had to survive for like a week was a jar of peanut butter I'm like dude you are insane um so I was thinking of him when I made this slide um but if you're young and healthy forever why not you know and if you don't need to work why not go for it uh the next one natal pods so I actually came up with this idea when I was writing my novel about you know utopian future and dystopian future and all that sort of stuff and I realized if we have low birth rates um and children need like a village the the the term is like it takes a village to raise a child we don't really have that today particularly in America some cultures do have like you know multigenerational homes um when I was when I was growing up our neighbors were a Hispanic family and so there was like five generations living in one house so like they brought the village with them but we don't know how to do that at least us white people don't know how to do that in America so what I suspect is we're probably going to start doing it on purpose and we actually already are um so there's what's called munes right now which is basically a bunch of single mothers get together and rent a big house so that they raise their families together so take that out to a logical conclusion where we do it more on purpose but also because there's going to be fewer children um in order to get children uh living in a way that is more natural and healthy for them because again if most people are putting off uh having children you're going to need to uh uh deliberately create the environment where children will have friends to play with because you probably noticed today at least I've noticed that in many suburbs like there might only be one house with children uh on the street and that's just that's not good for children and so natal pods the idea of deliberately creating that Village Eternal Gamers so you know my wife and I one of the things that we do is we we we love playing video games together a bunch of my friends they're all Gamers that's actually like they have a we have a Discord that uh one of the things we do is just coordinate gaming right and so one thing that I suspect is that if you have post- labor economics and you have uh indefinite lifespan you're like there are going to be people that they're just going to live for the game man like especially with VR AR some people are expecting full dive VR I've mentioned that before and I still have some some reservations but I'm coming around on like you know what if if your physical life is taking care of why not just go all out and treat your game life like a you know like it's a almost like a second life or maybe it's your real life maybe it's more important now obviously movies like Ready Player One show that as kind of a dystopian outcome uh which that's something to be uh mindful of cuz if the company who makes the games in the VR controls your life that's not good but I don't think it's going to I hope it doesn't turn out that way anyways I do suspect that there are some people that like that Nostalgia factor of like you know playing Halo all night with your buddies when you're like 12 we're going to have that and some people are going to have that for the rest of Eternity and then the last one finally is Master Craftsman so this is something that like obviously you don't to pick just one you might be a master Craftsman out in the countryside you might be a master Craftsman uh in a commune whatever but this is where because one thing that people talk about is like oh well if if you lose your job and you're going to live forever what do you do well I mean a lot of people have uh hobbies and talents and skills that they want to hone right like I know guys that uh they rebuild Mustangs right you know they just go find a barn find of a Mustang rebuild it clean it up you know either sell it keep it or you know put it on show or whatever and then they do it again there there are sculptors there are writers this is actually how my wife and I met we're both writers if we didn't have to work and we didn't have to worry about our health or anything we would probably just write we would like research history write sci-fi write High fantasy and that would be like our stick that would be what we do um you know in terms of uh challenging ourselves and stretching ourselves mentally I might probably still do YouTube I don't know um but we would see so anyways this is a set of uh potential longevity Lifestyles to kind of get the gears turning in terms of how you might live in the future if you don't have to worry about getting old or sick and you don't have to worry about money all right so in conclusion there are some potential problems with all this number one is gerent tocy so if you're not familiar with the word gerontocracy it means rule by the elderly uh and if everyone lives forever uh you know there's no reason that like Supreme Court and justices would ever retire so basically we're going to need Universal term limits for all government offices which we should have that anyways before people are living forever but once people are living forever we absolutely 100% need Universal term limits I think that's a pretty that's like a no-brainer solution so you know whatever uh number two wealth consolidation so you know Bill we have billionaires today if people have forever to accumulate more wealth and power then they're going to be trillionaires and then quadrillionaires so you know and the more the more money you have the easier it is to consolidate more power so the solution to this I think is also pretty simple which is more wealth taxes and more property taxes uh which that's going to be necessary just to keep the economy going because if all the money ends up in the hands of like you know the top 10,000 wealthiest people on the planet what's it doing just sitting there right one of the principles of neoliberalism is that money that's just sitting there isn't doing the world any good um because it's stagnant it's just static wealth that's sitting there doing nothing so wealth taxes and property taxes to keep things in circulation or you know there's other ways to incentivize that circulation but wealth taxes and property taxes are a mechanistic way to force that number three is cultural stagnation so in in universities in Academia there is this uh this little quip that says science advances one funeral at a time and that is because people uh often kind of get stuck in their ways but this is partially I think biological because there's this uh this is not a real medical term but it's called calcification um and so this is a popular thing in in chess because chess is super it's int it's intensely mentally rigorous and you can tell when you lose your mental flexibility I mentioned in a recent video that I can I can I've started feeling myself kind of calcifying which it's really kind of sad but like you know you you hit your mental Peak you know 25 to 35 so I'm just after like my mental Peak and it's all downhill from here and that really sucks so what I'm hoping is that some of these Rejuvenation therapies that we come up with uh also include mental Rejuvenation CU imagine that you're mentally physical mentally and physically healthy and flexible for eternity so maybe if Rejuvenation therapies keep us all young mentally and physically we will avoid that cultural and scientific stagnation another problem is demographic collapse so people are still divided on as to whether or not we're going to end up with overpopulation or underpopulation one thing that I like to point out though is that all advanced nations are are facing demographic collapse um and if people are going to live forever then there's even less pressure on having children so basically what I think is that's going to happen is that we're going to achieve population equilibrium because death rates are going to go down and birth rates are going to go down so personally I I don't think it's going to be an issue but we can incentivize population equilibrium with policies basically if po if birth rates get too low you hand out in incentives like say hey if you have children um then you know we'll give you a nicer house or we'll give you a bigger stipend for a nicer house this is this is something that some of the comments have said it's like oh well if you just incentivize people to have children they're just going to keep having children which That's The Welfare Queen myth which wasn't really true in the first place but you know you can change policy based on what the population demographics are now but the thing is is if people are living a long time if you might actually want to disincentivize having children so that might mean that you actually don't incentivize people having children at all you don't give them any additional money to have children um who knows we'll see and then finally number five regulatory capture which is that uh governments and businesses collude to ensure that they have all the power and that they focus on wealth generation and profit uh reaping just for themselves and basically they focus entirely on wealth rather than this other dream that we all have and so the current uh model mod of e economics basically says the idea is that we should generate wealth at all costs we should we should seek GDB growth this this growth only mindset completely excludes quality of life and other metrics and so basically what we need to do is come up with a new common dream a new common image for the future in order to uh work towards that so uh to wrap up here's my call to action for you number one advocate for post- labor economics I talk about it all the time on my channel is my it is my jam uh basically the tenants of post- labor economics is one actively work to automate away human jobs let's get humans out of the workforce uh because why none of us want to work menial jobs anyways so let's get out of that let's just make that a deliberate policy goal uh number two redistribute wealth obviously if we're not working we can't demand wealth uh from our labor anymore so we're just going to need to redistribute it and again that's that's not like Socialism or communism that is just it's going to be necessary through some mechanisms to keep the economy going uh because if we don't then wealth is just going to pile up in the companies and the wealthy people and the rest of us aren't going to have anything and the economy stalls out it's just not good and then number three for post- labor economics advocate for AI as a public good which it kind of already is because most of the research driving AI is all already open source but as AI advances we need to ensure that that the government treats it more as a public good and that's going to uh help drive us towards this post- labor economic uh model that I've presented number two Champion AI in business like I said automate everything um this is one of the reasons that I consult with clients is I help them with adopting AI learning about AI investing in AI that sort of thing and so by championing AI in business I'm helping drive them to that because like one of the specific things that I help my clients with is either uh headcount reduction uh which is like okay how do you get people how do you how do you uh create tools that that mean that you don't have to hire anyone else or or that sort of thing now that being said most of my clients have told their employees like hey our goal is not to fire anyone but you need to learn the AI tools uh so that's where we're going right now but in the long run I think we should explicitly try and just get rid of human labor as much as possible and finally number three vote accordingly um the conversation is still very much couched in you know old school capitalism and old school neoliberalism so we need to start the conversation around post- labor econ we need to find people who believe in it and people who will uh push this narrative uh then double down on AI and medicine and research uh AI is the Panacea so remember if you want this future then we need more AI we need it in research we need it in healthcare and victory is possible with a common dream which is why we're here today so thanks for watching uh my question to you for the comments is how will you live uh which of these models of longevity Lifestyles resonates with you and which ones did I miss I want to know what how you want to live cuz I came up with these in a vacuum but obviously this is just seven General boilerplate ideas tell me in the comments how you want to live all right have a good one cheers
