good morning everybody it is here the ace framework project is up and running and so today what I'm going to do is I'm going to walk you through the repo uh tell you about the project where we're at how you can participate and the road map from here so first uh the first thing that you'll see when you go to the ace framework that's uh Dave shop Ace framework is uh the repo is relatively small right now we don't have any examples I've got the core team together and we are brainstorming we're meeting soon uh to come up with some technical Milestones some designs and other organizational things the readme is relatively short and straightforward this is more of a guide to the rest of the repo so I've got a link directly to the framework itself here I've got some information about how to participate there's a few resources here which we'll get into then of course the overarching uh architecture of the ace framework and then finally some projects so this is where we'll start to dive in so if you're not familiar with the ace framework it stands for autonomous cognitive entity and the uh basically what this is it is a cognitive architecture a software architecture that is meant to work with llms and then when they're available multimodal models that will allow us to create fully autonomous entities such as personal assistants or companions Game World NPCs autonomous employees or embodied robots so those are the four overarching categories of ways that the ace framework can be implemented and so the team that I that I've built we've all agreed that we're going to start with the personal assistant and or companion for first so basically this is going to be a personal executive assistant that is capable of one thinking entirely autonomously to meet your needs without necessarily waiting for you to give any instructions so this is what we mean when I say fully autonomous because there's a lot of times that I'll say like oh yeah this is this is to create autonomous entities and they're like what do you mean by autonomy just think like robot think you know the Nestor classify from iRobot think about Commander Data from Star Trek think about all these uh think about Samantha from the movie her which I just re-watched which man that movie hits different today 10 years ago when her came out with Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson it was all speculation now it's being realized so that movie really hits different anyways point being is the idea here is to create machines that can think on their own that can set their own goals and objectives but to do so in a structured way that uh basically means that it won't hurt you or become toxic or dangerous or destructive so those are the four overarching categories that we're going to be pursuing uh within this project now let me give you a tour of the rest of the repo so right at the base layer I've got the ace framework here so the ace framework this is the this is the Deep dive into all of the layers with diagrams uh examples and so on um this was the first thing that I introduced so you're probably familiar with that uh the readme that's the page that we're on here I've added an agile chart so basically this is uh showing one how we're organizing the project as well as the roadmap so if you're not familiar with agile agile is a software development Paradigm that focuses on small teams and Rapid Improvement so what we're starting with is an MVP which means minimum viable product or POC which is proof of concept and so the very first thing that the team and I are going to be building is just like the simplest most cut down version that says hey it works that's the that's the goal here so the acceptance criteria that I have established for the MVP is it'll be python so it'll either be entirely python or mostly Python Meaning that it'll be more accessible to people it needs to be hackable meaning it's going to be built in such a way that it is easier to copy paste edit reconfigure so on and so forth because again the whole point of the MVP is just to show that it works and also make it more accessible to everyone else simple and easy uh again we want we want this to be as brain dead simple as as possible to set up and start and start playing with because again the idea is this is just to demonstrate functionality to demonstrate that it actually works that it's not just Theory um and so to that one thing that I want to say very quickly is that uh all the components of the ace framework have all been done but what I'm doing is I'm bringing it all together uh so as anyone who has built anything that is large and complicated knows that all the pieces might work independently but plugging them into each other that can be the hard part acceptance criteria number four is that there has to be some kind of visual component meaning that you can see it working or interact with it in a visual way um rather than just seeing code scrolling across the screen and then finally the the fifth acceptance criteria is that it must be a full implementation of all six layers and both both buses of the ace framework and if you're not if you're not if you're new to this and you're not uh sure of what I'm talking about when I say layers and buses you can take a quick look at the at the architectural diagram here so there are six layers they're hierarchical layers which basically is an order of operations in terms of uh what what handles what aspect and then there's a Northbound bust which is uh bringing Telemetry into the uh environment and then there's the southbound bus Which is the control scheme so the MVP must Implement all eight of those components uh not necessarily we're not we're not necessarily focusing on input and output yet the primary thing is that we need to create a thinking machine something that is that is uh forming structured thoughts and plans and so on um okay so that is the agile here's the contributing document uh so basically there's a few ways to contribute uh we've got the discussions tab which I'll show and show you in just a second there's also my Discord and patreon community so if you want a private Community I do have a I do have an ace framework tab set up in that Community uh just if anyone wants to jump in uh talk about it also I've had a few people reach out who want to consult on it because obviously I am not the only person doing autonomous agents and so on and so forth and so several of my clients particularly my newer clients have reached out and they want they want me to you know provide uh coaching or consultation on their architectures and and I'm happy to do so so that's another way to get involved now one thing that I do want to point out is that the the core team the initial team we do have that set up however there is a huge amount of interest in this project and so part of what I'm doing on the agile chart over here is defining how we're going to have this open source distributed uh project moving forward so the core team will consist of myself and the core team that I've already built um and then essentially what what I'll recommend obviously I'm not going to tell anyone what to do but for all the people that are reaching out that have particular implementations that they want to do the idea is that I'll recommend that you build an individual scrum team which is a team that is capped at seven seven people maximum and that you start with a lead developer so the lead developer is the one who's going to kind of Drive the vision and and focus on making sure that everything happens but then within the core team we'll have myself as a product owner and then we'll also have probably one or more scrum Masters I've already had several people volunteer to serve as scrum Masters and so if you're not familiar with a scrum Master the pretty much the role of the scrum Master is the master of ceremony the one who understands the process of Agile development and so they they basically like the train conductor that helps keep all the developers on track within a team um and it's basically what a scrum Master does is we'll sit in with with the scrum team of developers of seven developers maximum seven developers it doesn't have to be seven the scrum Master will sit in and provide guidance of like okay here's what you here's here's how you figure out what to do first here's how you conduct the meetings so on and so forth and so the idea here is that once we have the core team set up um those of us on the core team will be available to other folks who have uh who basically want a little bit of help and guidance implementing an open source implementation of Ace one of the four kinds that we just talked about and the idea is that uh as as as a community we will learn how to uh some best practices around how to implement this and we'll be able to share but the idea is that this this repository will be the primary uh like Nexus of learning how to deploy these autonomous cognitive entities so that's the agile and contributing documents I definitely recommend you take a look at those and then finally there's a resources document so here I captured a list of books at the top so there's a cognition Psychology and Neuroscience and then there's several Concepts and Frameworks such as Maslow's hierarchy of needs um and all the other kind of models that went into the inspiration behind Ace so this is it this is basically like a very very short citation page um and then finally I'll be accumulating YouTube videos um that uh that demonstrate the ace framework whether it's projects or breakdowns or whatever so there's mine and then synaptic Labs already produced a much shorter kind of introduction to the ace framework so thank you guys for doing that oh and they did that completely without like my permission or anything it's open source this is all under the MIT license and then finally the big thing that everyone has been waiting for is the publication so the uh the paper is here it is it's not yet up on archive um but I was given permission by the professor to go ahead and announce it so this is the actual publication that I partnered with Clemson University they actually reached out to me because their work is very parallel to what I'm doing so I want to send a huge thank you to Carlos Manuel and Wang Fon over at the human AI empowerment Lab at Clemson University so the paper is here it's ready you can download it it is incredibly well cited I think we have over 150 citations so we uh it's not we we didn't make this up um but there is a tremendous amount to unpack here so obviously I'm not gonna read all 37 pages of the paper to you but if you work through this the scientific paper you'll understand the psychology the philosophy the ethics uh and a lot of the other science underpinning the ace framework so it is there it is ready this is the big announcement and then I've also got a few other uh papers in the Publications page these are not all from me that's the only one that that I participated in but these are the most relevant uh papers that I have found so I've got a principal driven self-alignment um with minimal human supervision so basically this this kind of thing uh this paper is included because it one it comes from uh Carnegie Mellon and MIT IBM Watson AI lab so these are some serious folks but the idea here is to show that uh that you can have principal driven self-alignment so this will be specifically germane to the aspirational layer and the uh um agent model layer so layer one and layer three in order to understand how to keep these things on track autonomously another publication is the koala paper that I mentioned in a recent video um so this came out of Princeton and actually um the uh the professor uh Carlos who reached out to me he's friends with these guys uh over at Princeton so he collaborates with them um we're all operating in the same space the rain paper just came out so this is this is again about self-alignment um that uh that demonstrates uh prompting strategies for self-alignment even without fine-tuning so again definitely directly relevant to um to the ace framework and then I already showed you the Ace paper and then an older one is uh Jan lacunz um paper about the Ami his his architecture um I'm not particularly a fan of of this architecture which I've mentioned before so I'm not going to get into that again but I figured it would be good to have here just so that you know by ver by virtue of contrast and even though I'm not I don't necessarily agree with this it still good to see like what the state of the industry is okay cool so that is a full tour of the repository here um the other part of the of the whole repo is the discussions tab so this is the main tab that I want to end on which is you can see we've already had some robust discussion we've got people bringing up safety concerns we've got people um under like trying to understand what it would look like uh all kinds of thoughts so this is basically an open invitation um if you just want to learn about it like if you uh if you have like dumb questions or Noob questions come to the Q a section um and we'll be sure and it's not just me it's other members of the team are uh jumping in uh and answering questions uh so whether it's you've got questions whether you want to share so the show and tell section if you've got an implementation you want to share or a demonstration feel free to post it here the whole idea again is that the ace framework repository is going to be at least for the foreseeable future the Nexus of development for this framework and then eventually like again it's fully open source I I you probably remember from past projects I don't really have a desire to monetize this or keep control of it the entire purpose here is to teach and December eliminate this information and make it accessible as accessible as possible to everyone so that is where we're at thanks for watching um yeah this this is it jump in um you can also reach out to me on LinkedIn if you want to collaborate I've had quite a few other researchers want to collaborate on a similar and parallel projects uh specifically Germaine to chat Bots I've also been collaborating with people in various governments around the world to talk about Ai and AI narratives as well as how to generate buy-in one of my several of my recent clients uh and and friends and connections they are building AI startups that that interface with the government so this is another uh area of of uh interest that I have because obviously like you can have the best tools in the world but if the government isn't using it or the government isn't aware of how to use it correctly it kind of doesn't matter for the rest of us obviously business and government are different but we need one of my missions is to bring everyone to the table that means independent people that means businesses that means governments because you know if we're all if we're all on the same page we're all going to end up in a much better place so thanks for watching um I'm I'm going to be posting a little bit less um I'm moving over to medium just because I have so much content that I want to produce um and on that note I'm actually also building a video team then this is not it this is not a uh a request to join um the team is already built uh and we're just kind of uh dotting our eyes and crossing our T's so my production quality is about to go up and I'll we'll probably also have a co-host here soon uh so we're gonna we're gonna focus on more interviews we're going to focus on more of these open source projects we're going to focus more on education and tutorials but again the key thing is I'm going to have more help because basically I've been completely inundated by the sheer volume of stuff that I want to do and that I cannot do on myself and I finally got over myself and said you know what let me talk to some of these guys who are offering to help and let's get this going anyways I'm rambling now thanks for watching like And subscribe etc etc you know the drill but let's get this work done let's build some autonomous machines let's build some real life cortana's and uh Samantha's and whatever else and let's let's make the world a really cool future where we have uh these fully autonomous machines that can help us and make our lives better and uh you know ideally not kill us but you know wish in one hand all right I'm done later
