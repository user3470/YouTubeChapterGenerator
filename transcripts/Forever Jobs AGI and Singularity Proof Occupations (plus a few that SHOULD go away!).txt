morning everybody David Shapiro here with another video so I've been on a kick lately where I'm talking about Universal basic income and post-labor economics and and that sort of stuff and one question that came up and it was a really good question uh in a previous video I think I think people are starting to realize the capabilities and the shifts that are coming and so someone said okay well like we agree with your methodology more or less you know obviously nothing is perfect and like you know I'm forging ahead as fast as possible but he said like okay so how can we determine the jobs that will stay so I wanted to spend a a little bit of time exploring specifically automation resistant occupations so these are jobs that no matter how good AGI and robots get they may never go away um real quick plug for my patreon um the low tier uh the five dollar tier gets you access to Discord uh where we often hang out and so on the other uh uh tiers the 50 tier is you know I've got some private channels set up for uh for direct chat and then I do actually have a couple of my 300 tiers which allow for uh one-on-one consultations so uh moving right along basically AGI is coming we know that machines are getting exponentially smarter very quickly uh to the to the point that uh 32 000 people signed a petition saying stop progress uh and it was taken seriously apparently uh you know not not that moratoriums are in place but uh politicians and governments around the world are taking the the thing seriously and they're saying okay we need to innovate what we need to do it safely uh you know you look at at the the latest uh version of mid-journey and stable diffusion and like if you showed this to me and said that this was a photograph from the 70s I I personally could not have told you that it wasn't except probably that there's no camera in the reflection of her sunglasses um but like this is this is computer generated and so you look at the the ramp up of just the digital capacities if we assume that also robotic capacities are going to follow suit eventually that basically we end up with you know commander data and Westworld style hosts that are pretty much indistinguishable from Human but still superhuman like in terms of strength intelligence agility so on and so forth then basically we're going to the assumption that I'm making is that AGI will be intellectually morally ethically and creatively Superior to humans in every conceivable way in the not too distant future likewise I'm making the assumption that robots are going to be uh dexterous hyper realistic and as I said superhuman but in some cases completely indistinguishable from humans um unless they are designed to not look human and of course like there's been talks about like maybe you require that all robots have like you know a red light on their head or something I don't know anyways the point being is that human labor is going to become economically irrelevant let me say that again the the economic value of human labor is going to be zero uh before too long now that being said like okay like I you know I was saying there are some jobs that people are going to continue to pay for and I'll Define that in just a second um but I want to unpack kind of the economic Paradigm that's coming and of course there's the the tongue-in-cheek you know fully automated luxury space communism I do believe that that's actually coming especially when you look at hyper hyperabundance of energy with Fusion uh the breakthroughs with Quantum Computing that's happening the exponential ramp up of AI uh Microsoft just I think it was Microsoft they just announced that they want to um to do the next 250 years of Material Science in the next 25 years with the combination of artificial intelligence and Quantum computing like that is literally Sacha Nadella basically saying that he wants to do the ramp up to the singularity because guess what happens in 25 years we are almost exactly 25 years away from Ray kurzweil's uh prediction of the singularity um yeah so like what happens then if the marginal cost of pretty much all everything that you need drops to basically zero then like it almost doesn't even make sense for companies to exist so I was talking with someone about this like what if the marginal cost of Health Care drops to like five dollars per year in in terms of current economic uh US Dollars like if if the total cost of your health care drops to five dollars a year it's not profitable for a company to do it so you might as well just have the government pay for it um because it's practically free ditto for food housing uh other basic goods and services internet electricity obviously there's always going to be some desirable luxury goods that you'll need to pay for uh but that's a that's a conversation for a different story um or a different video or whatever anyways so just kind of setting the stage a little bit more I was listening to the uh Mark Andreessen and Lex Friedman podcast which was really good by the way and one of the things that he talked about and I I I knew of this thing but I he articulated it in such a way that was just like oh that's super clear and it makes sense and they were talking about the lump of Labor fallacy which is the idea that uh that the incorrect assumption that there's only a finite amount of Labor to go around and that once you automate it all away you get that fully automated uh luxury space communism and so but the what he explained was and I had to look this up to make sure that that I had it right but that the the reason that quote technology always creates new jobs it's not that technology creates new jobs what actually happens from an economic perspective is that technology reduces the cost of goods and services uh the cost of clothing goes down the cost of food goes down especially when you look at the Industrial Revolution so when the cost of your basic necessities and other goods and services goes down your dollar goes further meaning that you have uh increased buying power to allocate your money to other things so your AG consumer aggregate demand goes up elsewhere and so when you reallocate that money to other needs and wants then you basically create new Industries based on consumer demand so that's how I approach this problem as I said okay let's let's throw out AGI capacity let's throw out robots let's just assume that they're going to be better than humans in every conceivable way and in many cases probably preferable to humans but let's look at consumer demand for actual humans so that's how I basically approach this whole thing um the other kind of political Mantra or economic Mantra is that human demand is infinite which definitely seems to be true over the last century but the thing is is that not all human needs are infinite right just be like if food is five dollars per year that doesn't mean that you're going to eat infinitely more food you have fixed amounts of things that you need and also like if you have one Mansion you don't necessarily need a thousand Mansions right or if you you know if I if my dream comes true and I end up with a super yacht I don't need 10 right just one will do uh so anyways but that being said there is there's always more that we want um so what you could say is that human desires might be infinite but I don't even know if I agree with that because eventually there is such a thing as as good enough all right so defining automation resistant occupations uh the I was able to kind of identify six um six categories or six dimensions that might make an occupation resistant to being destroyed by automation so first is strong consumer preference so this is what I was mentioning where it's just for whatever reason humans want to pay another human to do a thing um now obviously like okay that's kind of difficult it's like okay well what do I want to pay a human to do and of course some people uh in the comments section say like there's nothing that they want a human to do if you have AGI and a realistic robot they say get rid of humans out of my life um which is fine some people might want to live like that I might want to live like that I don't know like I said in a in a podcast like I would love to have Commander Data as a friend um because you know what humans can sometimes be problematic uh intrinsic human qualities so this is stuff that is intrinsically human like basically emotions uh human authenticity so this is where it's come it comes more down to The Human Experience no matter how good an AI or a robot is at approximating or pretending to be human it will never have a truly Human Experience and so in some cases I want to hear about the human experience that another person is having and so that is what I mean by authenticity emotional resonance so this has to do with you know the emotional aspect but also the relational aspect because when a machine exists and it can make itself into any form factor to suit you then it's like okay well you know that's easy mode and that that's not necessarily a bad thing you know there's plenty of people out there uh who will choose to have uh emotional connections to machines and that's fine I honestly don't have any uh particular issue with that um that being said there's going to be people who prefer the real deal uh cultural context so this was an interesting thing as I was brainstorming and researching this was uh it was pointed out to me by chat gbt that in many cases there is a strong belief that humans must be involved in a thing uh whether it's you know religion or or whatever other cultural paradigms ceremonial things where like say for instance a wedding if you did have a robot priest officiate a wedding that might be a little bit weird and you might prefer to have a real human officiate your wedding just as an example and then finally intangibles so these are things where there's not really any uh compelling reason that a machine couldn't do it but there can be some intangible qualities or values added from having a real human doing the thing and we're going to unpack a whole bunch of careers in just a second um so actually yeah here we go we're ready jobs that probably stay pretty much forever and one thing that I want to point out is that uh in all of these cases the basically the assumption is that a robot or a machine or AGI could do it and could do it better than humans but the idea is that there will still be demand consumer demand for humans to do these things at least enough for some of the jobs to stick around I'm not saying that the entire economy is going to be these jobs I still think that many people are going to be just permanently out of work and they'll find other stuff to do um so musicians actors writers painters uh artists celebrities of all kinds uh Gamers streamers uh various kinds of competitors like chess and American Ninja content creators lifestyle uh communicators and influencers uh these are the kinds of things that are uh basically intrinsically human where you know like yes you might have like a robot actor or a robot you know an AI streamer that you follow it's already happening a lot of us are going to still prefer just to see real humans some people suspect that once like V tubers or whatever become uh good enough that like a lot of people won't care but you know what I think I think that the market uh will will probably fragment around this or or there will be market segments some people will just always prefer the real thing right that being said like we grew up with cartoons and CGI stuff like we are used to engaging with uh fake characters or or um not fake but like synthesized right like some of our favorite characters in all time are video game characters which are completely fabricated right uh now that being said some of them uh do have face models and voices from real people um but that being said I think that uh while we are comfortable with some level of CGI and and synthesis I think that there's going to be a persistent and durable demand for the real deal again in many cases humans are going to go fully go away but I think that just because we're humans the demand for A-list celebrities we're gonna figure that out it just as an example food and Hospitality so this is the kind of thing where a lot of people very much are looking forward to having their own personal robot Chef myself included I like having nice food and I don't always feel like cooking and even though I've Gotten Good at cooking especially because of the pandemic um I would still prefer not to have to do that myself now that being said there is something very human and Primal about a nice night out at a fancy restaurant um so because of that I think that restaurants and everything that goes with restaurants is going to stick around uh because there's always people going uh willing to pay for that kind of experience even if it's rare or of course there's there's probably always going to be wealth disparity so there's people that are going to prefer to eat out every night and they're not going to want to have a robot waiter they're going to have want to have a real sommelier uh another thing to consider is that food is a very Human Experience even if we have anthropomorphic machines they won't need food the same way that we do you know they're going to need power and data but we need physical sustenance we you know like getting a buzz from having a glass of wine and so because that experience is intrinsically and deeply human there's going to be a lot of people that will just always prefer humans and I could imagine like you know a a sign or part of the advertising scheme of a restaurant saying no robots allowed right you know 100 human weight staff I can definitely foresee that that happening in the future because you know what like there's some restaurants out there that they switch to having like the the uh the touch the touch pads like the order yourself and like on the one hand I get it like it's fast it's convenient but it's also kind of like hey just Serve Yourself you know peasant I'm like I don't really like that feeling um I like I like having uh having just even if it's just 20 seconds to tell a human my order or whatever so anyways I I think because of all the aspects of food and Hospitality there's going to be a very persistent demand for all kinds of jobs like concierge's like Caterers nutritionists sommeliers Baristas that sort of thing um so this was another uh category that I thought was kind of interesting which is uh cultural and meaning roles and so what I mean by a meaning role is these are the people that are uh used to have been would have been called like the priest class or whatever these are the Shepherds of society of of culture of meaning and of course like we don't have one coherent structure uh in society today because we have many religions we have philosophers we have secularists we have anthropologists um that sort of thing but uh the idea though is that the question of what it means to be human is an intrinsically human question and it also has to do with our culture and so these are things where it's just just by virtue of the fact that this is that we are humans and Only Humans will understand our experience even if machines can mathematically model our experience because you can go talk to chat GPT about the meaning of life right now and it is capable of having that conversation with you but you know that you were talking with something that does not have the same kind of experience that you do and so because of that uh you know the the meaning of of humanity and of life and that sort of stuff yes many people including myself will talk to AGI and robots about these kinds of things but they're still an intrinsic human quality to having that conversation with another human um particularly as uh you know new age religions and spirituality and psychedelic uh traditions and Shamanism uh come up you know like we we humans can have inexplicable experiences and we also have the the just deeply personal question of what is the purpose of my life or what is the meaning of existence that sort of stuff and that being said I am also one that will that that absolutely firmly believes that AGI will ultimately be asking similar questions um but even if we have the same question why do we exist what is the meaning of creation how did things come to be the way they are we're going to be approaching it from a different and subjective uh angle this one is something that I'm actually really dubious about and I'll talk about it again when I get to medicine at the end but mental emotional and relational Health in this case in many cases you probably will some people will prefer to have a real human you know talk about their you know talk to talk about their marriage with or to talk about you know their PTSD with or whatever but at the same time we have discovered that tools like chat GPT like the reflective journaling tool that I use almost every day is an incredibly powerful tool for mental emotional and relational Health in fact I the the the the reflective journaling tool that I created I use that more than I talked to like my wife now about these things I still talk to her about like you know what it is like what it is that we're going through and that we're working on and we talk about our relationship but this tool is also incredibly powerful and one thing that I just heard I I didn't I didn't find the study but I heard someone mention it on a podcast was that with um was it Sam Altman he I think he alluded to a study anyways what they what they have determined is that the current version of chat GPT the the most recent one um actually scores better on uh having lower implicit bias and explicit bias then even highly trained and highly conscientious humans and so this kind of touches on the fact that like okay humans are fallible and even the most well-intentioned most well-trained therapists and counselors and psychologists have their own biases whether it's bias from the medical establishment that they learned because that is certainly a thing you know I can't tell you the number of of uh of psychotherapists and stuff out there that that basically believe that CBT is the only thing that works and if it doesn't work for you then you're just lazy right and that's just a completely disingenuous and unprofessional position to have but plenty of them have that out there uh meanwhile on the other hand if you have a machine that is aware of these these faults and biases and that's not to say that GPT is perfect because certainly at a at a previous version it was incredibly ableist uh it basically presumes it kind of had inter internalized some of those ideas that like if you're struggling with relationships maybe you're the problem and it's not that like you know it basically wasn't aware of the social model of disability um I think it has gotten better at that anyways this is rapid this is rapidly iterating chat GPT has only been out for like about six months so you extrapolate this rate of progress out to years and decades we can assume that these machines are going to be much much better than humans uh at coaching other the machine is better at coaching humans through emotions mental and relationship Health um now that being said while I'm dubious about it I do suspect that many people will prefer humans and especially if humans are trained by AI I like you know these these Superior machines maybe humans will get better at their job uh I don't know but there's also uh privacy and stuff like that because the thing is is when you tell your you know pour out your heart to a therapist that you really hardly know like I don't know I just don't trust that that doesn't feel right to me right because that's not how humans have learned to process things that's not how we historically did it um and so but the advantage of having an AI therapist is that you can just delete the data physical health and well-being so this is again one of the kinds of things that yes a machine probably can do it better especially if we have like Westworld level hosts where they are indistinguishable from humans uh there will probably be such a high demand for the real deal um and I remember I think it was the opening scene of Westworld or the first episode where you know the the guest shows up and they're they're you know getting they're going through like the onboarding thing and the super attractive uh woman offers to have sex with you know because the guy's asking like hey can I have sex with like any host that I want and she's like yeah more or less and she's like I can have sex with you too if you want and he's like are you real and she said like why would it matter or or she'd ask like would it matter and of course like that's the central theme at least of the first season of Westworld which is does does Being Human matter if you have real suffering or real intelligence or real uh experiences and that sort of thing so in anyways I do suspect some people will prefer robots again for some of the same reasons that I just mentioned about like therapy and stuff but I think that there's going to be plenty of people that will just prefer the real deal for a massage therapists and personal trainers and yoga instructors it occurred to me that a robot yoga instructor might be super unfair because like they don't have to work for the flexibility right like their body is designed to be perfect and and good um now that being said if they're a better yoga instructor some people might prefer that so again some of these jobs will go away but the point is is that some consumers will demand to have a real human so this one is uh a little bit spicier um but you know uh sex workers of all Stripes adult content creators burlesque exotic uh dancers strippers that sort of stuff um again like this is something that I'm not necessarily that dubious on we see with the rise of CGI and uh generative AI art that like the appetite for porn is just basically infinite going back to earlier in the video uh now that being said I suspect that there will also be a uh a very durable demand for real humans right real bodies um the ethics of that are kind of dubious right like I'm more in the like libertarian Camp not hardcore libertarian but like you know if if someone wants to do a job and they do it safely and they do it ethically go for it um and there was a there's a few um let's say not experiences I have had but like thought experiments um well I'll just talk about this one so like in Blade Runner 2049 uh the the uh protagonist's AI girlfriend is she's just a hologram she doesn't have a physical body and so one thing that she does is she hires a human prostitute to have sex with him while she like projects her hologram over her which I think was a pretty cool thing and like that that scene being wedged into the movie kind of brings up the same question about uh you know like would it matter if it's a human or not and there was a there was an episode of a philosophy podcast I think the name of the podcast was very bad wizards but the one of the things that they asked was like okay for the sake of this thought experiment this is what I was trying to get to early for the sake of this thought experiment imagine that you can build a machine a robot that is indistinguishable from humans has an actual sentient experience and is designed to want to be abused like and I was just like that's a really interesting thought experiment um and there are certainly people that would uh that would apprec that would in that would indulge in that kind of experience uh and you know I'm still I'm still kind of like I'm not sure how to approach that it was a very interesting episode um moving right along uh craftsmanship and handmade luxury goods so this is something that we already see durable demand for particularly in the 80s and 90s as mass production of everything started ramping up and we started offshoring manufacturing jobs uh you know cheap overseas Goods like we got tired of that real fast and this is why Etsy exists right is because there is such a permanent durable demand for handmade luxury goods I don't think that's ever going away even if robots can make handmade luxury goods I I don't think that I think that having knowing that another human put their time into something I I think that that's going to intrinsically always be valuable to us and that's what I mean by like intangible like you could have a handmade uh you know knife like chef's knife that was made by hand and you could have an identical one made by a machine and you're still going to prefer the one that was made by a human because of that intangible value uh knowing that another human put their hands on it and put their time and expertise and their ex and their Mastery into that thing so I don't feel like I don't have to spend too much time talking about this one because like just look at the economic model of etsy and the fact that there are plenty of of creators out there who make a living on luxury goods that there really is no economic reason for it but it is purely a Sentimental or intangible reason that that exists fashion and Aesthetics so this was an interesting one that uh that I came up with actually uh Chad GPT didn't even touch on this um but basically when you look at at fashion and Aesthetics and by when I say Aesthetics I mean um models interior designers decorators that sort of stuff uh this is something that there in in many of those Industries there is a very very strong desire for authenticity now that being said there are also plenty of of them that uh expect cosmetic surgery like breast augmentation and liposuction and and makeup and that sort of stuff but in many of these industries there are trends for authenticity uh you know selecting for women that don't have breast augmentation or liposuction um there are even magazines that ban Cosmetics let alone uh computer touching up images via computer that being said there's plenty of people that use the automatic you know filters for everything now I suspect that with the rise of AI generated images it's like yes there is something that is aesthetically perfect about you know this uh you know CGI model this computer AI model but then it's just like I don't know about I don't know about anyone else but like I got tired of that real fast it's like okay I know that this is this is not a real person um and so it goes back to that intangible value of human Aesthetics of knowing that you're like whether it's uh you know a dress that was actually made by a real human uh and worn by a real human there's just something more grounding about that kind of thing again I think that some people won't care and some people will prefer the machines but there are going to be lots of us who actually prefer the real the real deal as well but also like Project Runway would be super boring if it was just robots I don't know that's just my opinion um this one is like really interesting so I actually saw her on not in and not in person but I saw a documentary about her years ago um she's a she was like the youngest funeral directory director in uh Britain uh at the time and I was just like wow that's a really interesting profession and so it just really stuck with me but like the tldr is like imagine a robot riding a eulogy for your mom um that would be kind of weird and of course like there was the what was it the the pastor in Germany recently like delivered a sermon that was written by chat GPT like I think that it's gonna happen especially once we develop like relationships with machines as like I said like I wouldn't mind having Commander Data as a friend and so like if I had Commander Data as a friend and I died I wouldn't mind if he eulogized uh he wrote a eulogy for me um but that being said there is something very deeply human about things like birth and death uh grief and other uh uh transitions in life right so say for instance um uh palliative care end of Life Care uh like uh I've actually had an interesting conversation with an end of life Doula um because they they it's a very deeply spiritual uh kind of role and um you know I think I think that yes there will be some plenty of people who don't mind or prefer the machine because of the level of precision because because it's less emotional or because they might perform better but also there's going to be lots and lots of people who just really strongly prefer humans to be part of these intrinsically human experiences uh shared outdoor experiences so this is something one of my best friends in high school actually she went to become a raft guide while she was in college up in the mountains and um like that was a really cool job but it's also the kind of thing of the shared stress of Adventure the shared struggle is actually a really important part of the experience and if you have a robot with you that that was never in danger and could you know pull you out of danger without any risk to itself that kind of lessens the experience a little bit uh and so like yeah you might have raft guides that have like a spare robot to help you fish someone out of the water if they fall in uh but that being said you're still going to want to have the human who has hiked up the mountain and struggled and knows what you're going through and knows what that experience is like and can help you get the most out of that experience uh there are uh tour guides and and Excursion leaders uh and this is actually something that's really popular with the elite right now uh what was it as brown something there's there there's multiple companies out there that basically you give them like a million dollars and they take you on like the coolest Excursion that you've ever been on and uh the description for one of them was like you know it's it's a it's an adventure that's so intense that it'll be seared into your memory it's like that sounds painful but you know what if you're bored and Rich and you have more money than you know what to do with have at it uh so point being though is that there will always be demand for those really intense uh visceral outdoor experiences and Adventures journalism is something that uh I think that it particularly with the rise of AI and disinformation a lot of people myself included already like I'm just gonna tap out of of uh of you know AI generated news and stuff like I want to I want to have a parasocial relationship with a reporter or a news commentator or investigator that I trust who does the work of sifting through all the all the noise and tells me what they think what they truly think and feel so this again comes down to that emotional resonance that was mentioned at the beginning which it's like hey I want a human to tell me what they think about this news I want a human to tell me how they feel about the way that things are going because that's what I connect with some people again like I said some people aren't going to Care some people will prefer the ai's unbiased analysis because again there's already evidence emerging that we can make large language models less by highest than pretty much 99 of humans so like yes I will I absolutely uh appreciate that existence because I want you know the AI to look at all sides and you know give me the ability to like say okay well what is you know what is the story what's missing what are the gaps you know what is this side saying what does it mean the AI will help us analyze all these things which is great but I still need that intrinsic human connection to tell me like okay like what does this mean to me as a person care profession so this is another one that's like kind of dubious because like and I'll talk about this uh more again at the end once we get to Medical Care uh but basically I suspect that there will still that there will be a durable preference that some people will just say you know what like I know that there's you can get a robot Nanny and they're technically better but I still just prefer you know to hire the the neighborhood babysitter you know for a little Johnny or whatever um that they just prefer that authenticity again it comes down to it it's really just preference it's not a matter of what machines can or can't do because we're again we're assuming that the machines are ultimately going to be hyper realistic um but the idea is what is it that people are willing to pay for and I suspect that there will always be people willing to pay for humans in care professions uh now that might change over time particularly if the economic uh economic shift like if hiring a human to do the job costs 10 000 times as much as it costs to have a human do the job that's a pretty steep bill but also if the quality of care that machines can render is also a thousand times better and safer and more reliable we might actually see a collapse of that demand not sure but I do I do suspect that some people regardless of how sophisticated robots become will still prefer humans Okay so I kept alluding to like medical professions and this is where uh actually I don't know how this is going to be received some of these ideas I actually got from you guys in the comments so maybe maybe you guys are already on board but some of these might kind of be a little a little bit contentious a little bit spicy but let's talk about you know we talked about a whole bunch of jobs that will probably stick around forever uh now let's talk about jobs that maybe should go away all right so first uh some of you are I can just hear like cheering and screaming at your screen like yes get rid of the politicians uh there's a few primary reasons to do this so one remember the the thought experiment here is that machines are going to be intellectually morally ethically and creatively Superior to humans in all ways from Strictly a structural standpoint if machines get to that point it would probably be unethical to allow humans to make decisions that influence other humans just by virtue of the fact that the machine can make a better decision and a more robust argument that's going to be more fair and more Equitable and less biased now just just from performance standards that's to me that's enough of a reason to replace politicians with machines if they get to that point there are more reasons than than that though uh not the least of which is conflicts of interest politicians often make a lot of money while they're in politics at least here in America so that's like hmm maybe maybe they don't actually have uh the best interests of their constituents in mind whereas if we design AGI correctly as long as it has power or whatever it's trying to optimize for like it's not going to have the same conflicts of interest another thing or another aspect of that is dubious motivations some politicians want power just for the sake of power which it's like that's maybe not the best reason that uh someone should be given power uh another thing is cognitive biases as I mentioned Prejudice and uh and worst of all the most Insidious one that people don't talk about enough is trauma politics so this is basically someone with unaddressed childhood trauma or PTSD and they're basically seeking power and control and influence as a means of self-soothing whether it's their trauma resulted in personality disorders or other kinds of reactionary sensitivities uh yeah I mean humans have a basket of flaws that it's like if we can get rid of that and have machines that make more Equitable uh unbiased and fair decisions and that they make better decisions that are more rigorously thought through maybe maybe we should focus on getting rid of politicians in the long run again this is a pretty high bar uh and it will take a lot of time to convince people and get them on board but if again if the track record proves it out over many many years that that machines are just better and here's the thing is I already know that in in in diplomatic core and state departments and governments they're already using chat GPT to help make decisions the AI is already influencing politics uh so like it's gonna happen by degrees I guess is the point is uh you know right now the AI is the tool but then soon we're going to have semi-autonomous tools and eventually we're going to have fully autonomous tools and then once the tools are fully autonomous it's like well why is the human there this one I think is probably going to be uh pretty contentious for some people and some people are going to be super on board with it like I said I get a lot of these ideas from the comments but uh basically police and soldiers have the same flaws as any other humans we're all humans they make mistakes regardless of how well trained they are and also some of them joined the police in the military for the wrong reasons uh because they want Power because they want to feel Macho because they want to harm people there are literally people who join the military and join the police because they want to have an opportunity to shoot someone and yes in the past when you when you want to hire someone who is ready willing and able to use Force to hurt someone else like you actually need that if you're in a very cruel contentious combative and barbaric world I think we should strive to build a less barbaric world and so then that says like okay well if you build a robot army that follows the Rules of Engagement to the letter you could actually really drastically reduce the rate of rape and torture and war crimes and other things now the big caveat here is that uh that is unless the robot army is actually explicitly programmed to do those things or allowed to do those things uh because this is actually the explicit policy of some Nations out there to deliberately inflict suffering on civilian populations to break their spirit so this is something that it's like it could go either way but at least if you remove the human aspect of it where Some Humans Do it for the wrong reasons then it's up to political decisions but again if we have robot politicians who don't really care about inflicting human suffering they're not going to program the robot army to inflict suffering and ideally we don't have it all anyways because the idea is like if you can figure it all out in simulation and you know what the other side is capable of and so on and so forth it should ideally never come to force anyways this is a this is a pretty strongly held personal opinion so I'll be curious to see how people react to this in the long run and remember the assumption that we're making is that robots will be superior to humans in all ways and that AGI will be intellectually creatively morally and ethically superior to humans as well as that evidence is already emerging Transportation so again if machines have a uh have a proven track record that means that they are safer and more reliable than humans it would probably be unethical to allow humans to drive and to fly uh and uh we all have lots and lots of experiences of Highly dubious drivers who probably shouldn't be on the road uh you know I think that uh I I for one really look forward to uh full uh full fully autonomous like level five self-driving cars uh because when we get to that one driving is going to be a lot safer for everyone it's also going to be a lot more accessible because it's going to Super drive down the cost of driving um which is going to open up the world for a lot of people who either can't afford to drive or are too infirm to drive on their own or whatever because because physical personal Mobility is actually a really big component of individual liberty anyways that's a whole other can of worms but point being is that in this case where we're imagining that machines are far superior to humans in pretty much every way it would probably be illegal to allow a human to drive it which would then materially put other humans in danger hazardous jobs is another thing and I feel like this is pretty uncontroversial uh basically just imagine this there's a robot firefighter that it doesn't matter if it gets you know burnt to a crisp because like it's programmed not to have a sense of self-preservation but it's also faster stronger and has better reflexes than a real human firefighter which one do you want pulling you out of a burning building the answer seems pretty obvious to me um you know and this is demonstrated in all kinds of video games and and and TV of course you know my favorite example is uh is Commander Data from Star Trek but this was also an iRobot right where like the robot saw like an accident happen and they immediately jumped into the water to pull people out of the car right and Will Smith of course in in that movie he was been out of shape because the robot saved him and not the little girl but if it was only humans he would have just died too right so that's I mean the survivor's guilt which is that's his own problem but point being is that for any kind of hazardous job I think that it would probably be unethical to allow humans to do those jobs if robots can do them better and and safer and so on uh medicine so this is this is one that uh is probably going to be pretty uh controversial but again imagine that that that computers and machines and AGI and robots have a better Trek track record than humans even if you prefer a human doctor in the case where machines are better than than human doctors in all ways I think it would probably be illegal for humans to practice medicine and uh I remember talking about this on Reddit a couple years ago when I was learning to use chat gpt3 and I I pointed out to someone who was learning to be a radiologist or something I was like Hey like there's a tool here that can already do all the things that you're doing and it it it's it's faster and and you know the person just completely went ballistics you know rattling off about like it would be impossible for a machine to ever understand like you know what X Y and Z things mean and you just rattled off a bunch of stuff and it's like yeah you just plug all that into chat GPT right now and it'll tell you exactly what it means um and the the the evidence is building um I love this quotation oops come back uh I'm stunned to say better than many it's better than many doctors I've observed this was Dr Isaac cohane um when he was talking about gpt4 and this is a computer scientist and physician from Harvard right so this is like cream of the crop already saying that like yeah this this machine is already better than many actual doctors so I suspect that uh that medical professions are going to go the way the dinosaurs just by virtue of the fact that humans will just not be able to compete not to mention the fact that human doctors are ludicrously expensive um so this is what I mean when I say like Medical Care could go to five dollars a year because if you if you get rid of the need for most hospitals due to preventive care and regenerative medicine you get rid of the need for nurses and doctors and phlebotomists because you have Superior robots then it's like medical care just is an outpatient thing that you you know like you go to the pharmacy uh you know once a year and they'll they'll you know take a blood sample and say okay here's your medicines for the year go home right and oh and you won't need to be on medicines chronically because they're going to actually fix the underlying problem and cure you and so then it's like oh here's an injection to fix this problem that you have you're good to go for the next 10 years that's kind of how I think medicine is going to go and so uh this somewhat maybe controversial opinion is that eventually I think that we should probably actively try and get rid of uh medical uh professions on the human scale all right so here's some conclusions Let's uh let's try and pry that Overton window open just a little bit more um automation resistant occupations are those that humans will always be willing to pay for regardless of machine's capacity and capability so again there's many reasons for that uh the intangible value the emotional resonance the connections now the jobs that should go away are those that concern and potentially infringe upon the safety and rights of other humans because again all humans are flawed all humans are biased and if machines can demonstrate that they are less flawed and less biased than humans then they will have a better track record in terms of safety and respecting human rights and and like I just think that like in the in those cases it would not be ethical to allow humans into jobs that could infringe on the safety and rights of other humans uh and I don't know if that's controversial let me know what you guys think in the comments you always do anyways so yeah I hope you enjoyed uh thanks for watching cheers
