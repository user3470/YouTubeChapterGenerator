AI is expected to destroy uh many jobs most jobs we don't know uh there's been different predictions out there but one question that I get is should I go to college I I get this question personally uh direct messages on LinkedIn uh Discord patreon but I also see it echoed a lot in YouTube comments and Reddit comments and pretty much everywhere and so young people today are uh understandably a little bit worried about the future and how they should prepare for it so I am here to do the longc coming Deep dive as to should you go to college in the age of generative Ai and the fourth Industrial Revolution the answer is an unequivocal yes with an asterisk so let's unpack this and before we get started I do need to say this is not Financial advice you should always consult a licensed professional for anything to do with uh with life money whatever this is just my personal take were I 20 years old today if I was 17 to 25 today this is kind of the advice that I would give myself so keep that in mind uh you know your mileage may vary so for some context there are a lot of big names out there such as Goldman Sachs that are predicting that AI could destroy as many as 300 million jobs starting with white collar work uh which is kind of what people did not necessarily expect at first it came for the art artists now it's coming for the doctors and lawyers soon it'll be coming for the executives and then everyone who's left standing will be doing child care and plumbing I don't know I don't think that's how it's going to play out especially when you look at the recent news about the advances in robotics uh my personal take is that we are heading for a post- labor economic World basically human labor is not going to be the primary driver of the economy within probably 5 years uh that's my personal prediction I stand by that and I haven't seen any news that makes me change my mind so if this is the world we're heading towards why should you go to college should you go at all as I said my answer is an unequivocal yes so let's unpack why first and foremost you need to understand the original purpose of universities so uh Oxford University has been around for oh almost a thousand years um there are some schools that are much older but by and large the university system that we know today uh particularly in the west uh really came into fruition really uh was kind of codified and solidified during the Renaissance period so the 14th 15th and 16th centuries uh in Europe and the purpose of a university the reason that it is called a university is because the purpose was to create Universal men um which was basically members of the Upper Crust of society in order to like well okay so some context for the renaissance renaissance is the rebirth The Rebirth of learning and so what Society did at the time was there was this hard pivot away from ecclesiastical uh learning and more towards hey let's show more interest in history let's show more interest in the broader world let's show more interest in the Arts and philosophy and and that sort of stuff and the idea was to create a very well-rounded person who would be a productive member of society so these are the the gentlemen and to a much lesser extent at least until later the ladies of society and so the idea here was that if you go to university one that is a class signifier that you are a member of probably the landed gentry or nobility uh but also it was so that you would have a common understanding when you joined Society uh this was not for the peasants this was not for the proletariat this was exclusively for the rich and wealthy now fast forward a couple hundred years and we have World War I World War 2 we have the Industrial Revolution and we have the rise of knowledge work suddenly everyone needs an education so only within the last 80 years or so did our relationship with universities really drastically fundamentally change and let's unpack part of that change so part of that change was a pivot from being a good member of society because remember if you are landed gentry or nobility you didn't need it to go to school for a job that's not what you were training for you were training to be a member of noble Society or landed gentry or whatever whatever uh cultural paradigms uh represented the Upper Crust of your Society now with the Industrial Revolution there was a rise of factory jobs of urbanization and that sort of stuff and it is not an accident that classrooms today look like factories that is 100% identical and actually I asked mid journey to create a classroom slf Factory from the Industrial Revolution and you can see like oh these rows of desks with you know this somewhat oppressive environment where you're just supposed to sit quietly and do your work without causing much uh disruption the like everything from the the way that classrooms are structured to the way that there's like one master at the front of the classroom who's lecturing to you to even the uh requirements of and and paradigms around discipline work quietly don't talk back you uh you have to be subjected to arbitrary uh punishments and requirements that are often not fair um and and also devian is not tolerated in public schools all of this comes directly from the Industrial Revolution and so what happened was in Europe particularly in the German and Austrian system because God bless them I love them they are great systemizers what they did was they systematically restructured public education around Preparing People to work in Factory iies this has stuck around for 120 years and we have when we we people say oh well we can't agree on what's the best for Education this is obviously the best way we just want to create docile workers but when so just taking a step back I'm going to get off my soap box in a second uh my first year of Education I went to monasi school which is a fundamentally different structure of Education uh for for Early Education and it was um I still remember monor School as like my best experience at school uh so we actually do have alternative paradigms of how to approach education it's just we are locked in this hyperproductive uh capitalistic Industrial Revolution model of we need to we need to spend 880,000 hour or however long it is 20,000 hours um that that children spend in public education preparing them for the economic world of basically subservience and obedience to arbitrary systems of power uh that shapes the modern uh education system and this extends to the university system as well so this is public education and University now obviously in some respects the education system is trying to to minmax it's trying to optimize say well we don't want to pay teachers a lot of money we don't want to have a lot of teachers so let's have 30 students per classroom but we we know empirically that this is not an optimized model of Education the best model of education is is to have one master or Maestro for every four to five students um these Master teaching methods have been well studied and well established so anyone who says well we don't actually know the best way to educate that is absolute baloney we we we know that one-on-one tutoring with experts is the best way to educate people um this is codified in what's called um Bloom's 2 Sigma problem so blooms 2 Sigma problem uh shows that if you give someone uh expert one-on-one tutoring they perform two standard deviations above how they would have performed with a public school education that is how bad public schooling is it is two standard deviations below optimal uh so yeah I used to be married to a teacher so like I'm not going to say that I'm a 100% Authority on this but I also spent uh some time earlier this year interviewing Educators both teachers and and faculty all over the world and this is actually like yeah so oh boy all right off my Soap Box moving on okay so now that you have some historical context as to why Public School Systems and University Systems are utterly broken uh and why also they are so heavily uh skewed towards education or sorry uh towards uh factory jobs why would you go to university today well let me tell you why so first is experience uh there's all kinds of things that happen when you go to university when you stretch yourself there's pressure there's challenge there's new ideas there's social groups uh there's Adventures that you can go on some some of my friends have gone on really cool like Arctic expeditions to go like put sensor probes at the bottom of the ocean um but mostly it's about how you change yourself you stretch yourself you challenge yourself and you become a better version of yourself but not just that because it's like okay well why am I becoming a better version of myself we'll unpack more of that in just a minute but there's the like when you overcome these challenges when you learn these things when you have these social experiences you come out intrinsically different and it sets you up to be uh in a better shape the rest of your life this is why people that go to college even when you correct for things like income uh and you know underlying intelligence or whatever people who go to university tend to be happier and they also tend to have better relationships in the rest of their life now obviously that is a there is still some privilege there there's still some class signifiers because there are plenty of great people who are more than intelligent enough that just don't have the family background or financial stability to be able to go to college so it's really difficult to disentangle privilege from some of these other long-term results but that being said there is still a lot of evidence that going to college going to universities and getting uh particularly Advanced degrees it does something to your brain and your personality that uh pays dividends the rest of your life uh now one thing that I will say is that the people that I know that have that have advanced degrees or just any degree they tend to be more responsible citizens and of course I can I can hear some people saying well responsible citizen according to whom according to those that they you know indoctrinated at the University it's like well okay one thing though is that a lot of people who go to university actually have some of their worldview shaken up uh I remember one of my friends he was he came from a rural background his whole family was religious and like he was still vaguely religious by the end of college but he's like yeah like going to University is a really good way to like change your mind and even my wife like she had uh U my my current wife um she had you know roommates in college that had some really interesting ideas about how the world work when they got there and then their entire worldview was shaken up and now you might say well that's just liberal indoctrination it's no that shaking up is what naturally happens when you are exposed to more of the world now also being a responsible citizen is uh is partly knowing history people that are ignorant of history have a really hard time understanding why the world is the way that it is it's like okay well all I know is that there's something happening today that I don't like and that's the long and short of it yeah but understanding the historical context makes you a much better more more responsible citizen um just by virtue of the fact that you understand why we got where we are and where we're going and what has happened in the past so for instance uh I am Ultra Ultra Progressive as is my wife at the same time we like our we will talk about history from prehistoric times to Bronze Age to Classical period uh global history and with that historical context we understand geopolitical conflict and War and all the G you know the geopolitical game of chess and because of that because we have a more nuanced understanding as to why conflict happens we understand policies that we don't necessarily agree with on principle for instance uh you know un NATO uh US America like you know uh expeditionary military forces it's not ideal but we understand why it's there uh so that's what I that's an example of what I mean by being a responsible citizen an educated citizen is a respons ible Citizen and also that idea goes back to ancient Athens um the idea was that part of that Master student uh training that people like Socrates did uh the idea was to create better more informed citizens who could participate in the dialogue required to steer Society so I'm not going to read the rest of it but you get the idea that like that that expanding your knowledge of the world translates to being a better participant in civil Society another thing is being a team player so uh news from the front throughout my career so for some background I have exactly five weeks of college under my belt before I realized this isn't for me uh but what I will say is that there are a lot of employers that require uh or strongly prefer college degrees and one of the reasons that they do is that uh people with college degrees tend to be better team players and part of the reason for that is that they have gone through and worked with people that maybe they didn't like they didn't get along with maybe that they had fundamental disagreements with but by by through practice they learned to still get the job done to still get the project across the Finish Line to tolerate those differences and to gain those social skills that uh lead to better outcomes in the workplace and so this is something that I'm still learning I'm almost 40 years old and I'm and because I didn't have that experience I'm still learning the nuances of being a good team player learning leadership skills that sort of stuff some of my friends that went to Harvard they are like the nicest people that I that I know why because they went to a top university in the world and they they already had those experiences and kind of had some of the the ego not necessarily like ground out of them but they were polished let's put it that way um and so by going through those difficult uh experiences those challenging experiences and learning that hey like this is how I can relate to people this is how we can get the job done this is how I can be a Kinder person that sort of stuff again uh there is some pre-selection here going on because people that are intrinsically equipped to succeed in the University system they might have an easier time of it they might go further they might have a different disposition kind of like cats so like I like both cats and dogs U my wife says that I have a cat personality which is very true um if I want attention I want attention and if I don't want attention Leave Me Alone um but I like cats and dogs and for anyone who's who's ever own cats you know that all cats have different personalities some cats they are very tolerant and they will let you like play with them in rough house other cats you look at them wrong and they will bite you um some people are like this too I'm not saying that they will literally bite you but some people just have they're more uh cheric in their disposition I'm a sanguine cheric disposition which means it's like ah that person's an idiot I don't want to work with them um it's probably also because of my Jewish background a lot of us Jews are very cranky uh could be cultural I don't know anyways point being is that part of going to University is learning to be a better team player which again H pays dividends in the long run uh you might say like well I'm never going to use that it's like yeah come back to me when you're trying to build a house and come back to me when you are uh trying to plan a wedding come back to me when you're trying to do any number of things that require a lot of people uh like I said one of the things that I'm doing is I'm leading an open source project and I guarantee you I would have been better equipped to run these projects if I had uh you know stayed the course at University so being a team player that will uh serve you for the rest of your life whether or not you are in a uh corporate environment whether you in a job cognitive development so again stretching yourself University is a major Catalyst to just change your brain uh the struggle that you go through into you know to cram to cram in knowledge to gain new skills new abilities even if you forget the the base material your brain is still fundamentally changed and there's not much more to say about this but just like talk to people that have been to University versus those who haven't and what you'll notice is that there's just a different kind of cognitive capacity and set of metacognitive skills that they have and that is going to again pay dividends for the rest of your life okay so I've I've told you like what universities were for and why you know I would recommend going to University so then what do you study so first and foremost what I will say is study your passions uh one thing that is going to change I suspect over the course of the 21st century is we are going to Pivot away from utilitarian approaches to education like you go to college to get a good job well if good jobs are going going away then you go to college to engage with your passions uh one thing that I learned a long time ago in the workplace in my own life is there is no substitute for passion um you know like I see people that just try and force themselves into uh jobs or careers or even startups that they're not passionate about and that just doesn't work so yeah there is something about indulging in your passions and you know if your passions are games crate lean in if your passions are archaeology so the reason that I that I uh made this image and I don't know if you can tell that it's not a photo this is actually made by mid Journey but um one of the stories that my wife tells is that is that um in her archaeology class there were uh some elderly people that were returning to college after many many years because they you know they had retired they had they had their career behind them and they're like well you know I really what I really wanted to do all along was study art archaeology and so then they went back to do that and wouldn't it be great if we could all just do that from the outset uh so yeah there is a lot to be said for indulging in your passions especially if there is not some utilitarian uh or instrumental goal that you're trying to reach such as maximize your income or whatever but also if you IND indulge in your passions you'll go further anyways another thing to do is to focus on becoming the right person and so what I mean by that is you are an agent you are an agentic entity moving through the world and so when you go to university if you go to university what I would recommend is that you try and strive to make yourself into the right person for the rest of your life uh and so here's some here's some here's some things that I mean when I say like make yourself into the right person engage in intentional growth CH like deliberately challenge yourself step outside of your comfort zone join you know clubs that uh like Toast Masters Club uh take classes that you're weak at that sort of stuff just challenge yourself not to get the grade but for the sake of challenging yourself for the sake of becoming more well-rounded uh focus on diversifying your skills uh whether that's social skills mathematical skills scientific skills physical skills if you're not particularly athletic or physically coordinated maybe take a sports class to to try and not necessarily to become a better sports star but to compensate and make up for any deficits that you have focusing on self-improvement look at your rough spots if there's something that you're not good at then like deliberately challenge yourself that's what I'm in the middle of doing right now it's like let me step outside of my comfort zone and just practice these things that um I need to get better at whether it's leadership or communication or whatever uh and whether you know you I'm not saying that you should say like I'm going to be a universal man or I'm going to be a universal woman but that is one model that you could pursue you could say you know what maybe maybe the maybe the Athenians had it right maybe uh maybe they had it right in Florence uh in Italy back in the Renaissance maybe you know I should try and be this well-rounded person who is really just trying to be a good member of society and then finally uh focus on the the skills and development that will improve your quality of life namely those communication skills those emotional skills the self-awareness the cognition and the teamw working skills all of those are going to serve you the rest of your life whether or not you're working uh stem education so a lot of people say like I'm I'm planning on getting my masters in computer science should I even bother when AI is going to take it over and I will say yes unequivocally uh foundational knowledge of the basic Sciences uh whether it's stem or not is going to serve you the rest of your life knowing how the world works at a basic level that's never going to change whether or not AI is doing the job for you it will give you a common lexicon so that you can communicate with the AIS even when the AIS take over all science and space exploration and whatever whatever happens it will give you the ability to communicate uh with other people and machines and whatever else uh and so then there's the the base reality aspect which is AI and machines and humans we all operate in the same physical plane of existence so even if AI dislocates a lot of jobs you're still like you're still a human and you're still made of carbon and hydro uh hydrocarbons and and you know we're not silicon based but the machines might be so there's all kinds of stuff that is just going to serve you in terms of understanding how the world works even even if you get a stem degree and even if you never use it um there are other kinds of Irreplaceable skills and enriched perspectives that you can get but I'm kind of uh Reinventing the wheel here so I'll move on civic responsibility so Civic responsibility is uh something that I would recommend that people focus on when they go to university today which is understanding things like civil rights and human rights and understanding uh various governments around the world monetary policy fiscal policy voting understanding the ethics that go into things like why is freedom of speech and freedom of thought so important why is uh right to privacy so important understanding all of these kinds of things will make you a better uh more well-rounded a citizen a better voter uh you know better neighbor whatever um and but also the the key thing that I want to point out is be human Centric technology can change but you know and and you know transhumanism post-humanism we might change eventually too but we're still going to be fundamentally I hope human at the core and so understanding humans the human story human history the human mind and uh human societies that is going to be a permanent set of skills that everyone could benefit from so that's this is another thing that I would recommend focusing on for anyone going to University today okay so I did say that there was one gigantic asterisk at the beginning so let's unpack some of those exceptions the first and first and foremost is University is not for everyone uh me as a highly neurodivergent person uh University Systems today are just not for me um I would be bored in every class um yeah so that being said there are alternative paths if uh if University is not for you um there's vocational schools there's online courses that sort of stuff um one big problem with many universities is that there is uh still a need for Conformity and it's not necessarily a problem it's uh it's good for some people bad for others um I need to be self-directed I need to be able to engage in my own curiosity I have a really hard time following the structured course that someone else has laid out for me but some people really thrive in in in a highly structured environment they're like give me the structure I need the opposite I need no structure uh there's also of course Financial considerations and and and other other aspects you might not have the personal or or familial stability to do it which is one thing that I'm really hoping that we are able to fix as we move towards post- labor economics where it's like hey you want to go to university go for it uh you know like we'll make sure that all of your needs are taken care of so that you can go anyways uh yeah so that's about it you might have you might have uh unique goals that don't necessarily align with that like if you're trying to go out on physical Adventures like there's all kinds of people that they want to travel the world um university might not be the right thing if you're a DieHard artist now I will say that there are some really great art schools and conservatories out there so anyways point being is that there are going to be people for whom University is just not the right fit so I don't want to I don't want to promote a one-size fits-all approach because like I said as much as I would have benefited from going to University it just wasn't for me uh another reason that universities might not be for everyone is that they can be harmful environments uh as I mentioned before uh the current school system is very much geared towards a very singular uh view of reality uh which is that you need to go to you know basically get ready for your career uh there are also plenty of social dyamics at play there's pecking orders there are there's you know bullying there's gender discrimination there's racial discrimination there is a lack of accommodation and awareness for Disabilities I've actually talked to several people about how universities approach uh Dei initiatives and basically it is incumbent upon you the disabled person to advocate for yourself and many in many cases there's nothing the university can or will do it's like well it would be great if we could you know tolerate disability and help you out but the best we can do is give you 30 extra minutes on tests we're not going to do anything about bullying or anything else and to be fair corporations are the same way which is basically conform or get out uh there's also academic pressure which some people do not handle that kind of pressure well I am a uh I am a low pressure tolerant person which is why uh I have engineered my life career and all of my initiatives around that vulnerab ility that I have which is like that's why I delegate I learn to delegate uh in order to keep the pressure off of myself so that I can spend more time thinking and then of course Financial stress but hopefully as I mentioned we can alleviate the financial stress with post labor economics so this was like drinking from a fire hose here are some final thoughts um and some observations most of my friends have degrees some of my best friends all have graduate degrees whether it's Masters or phds and uh but I don't so I'm like I'm like the odd duck out but I've also been to like cocktail parties and stuff and just like jump into into conversation with people talking with them about their area of expertise and they're like how do you know so much about this it's like I'm just curious I just I love learning and uh but at the same time I've also learned to recognize uh those deficits that I mentioned throughout this video that I possibly could have overcome if college or university was right for me and if I had the right uh situation in order to be able to go there uh now once we achieve post labor economics it's entirely possible that I'll go back um I don't know we'll see so thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this remember not Financial advice make the best decision for you I just hope that this perspective will help you make a more informed decision for yourself have a good [Music] one [Music]
