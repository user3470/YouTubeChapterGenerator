good morning everybody David Shapiro here with another video so today's video is going to be about the salvation fantasy or the Dark Side of utopian narratives and so before I even get started a lot of you might be saying well but Dave you're the one who's constantly talking about Utopia which is exactly why I Define Utopia in very very concrete measurable terms such as standard of living individual liberty and social Mobility by defining Utopia in those very concrete measurable terms I deliberately try to de-identify it with these other more salvation fantasy narratives so let's unpack what a Salvation fantasy is but before we do that just a quick plug for my patreon everything I do is uh provided for free no ads no friction including my videos and all my code and all my research but I am 100 dependent upon Grassroots support such as from you so if you like what I do and want to keep me in business please go ahead and jump over and support me on patreon okay well all that back to the show so technology fundamentally is by and large a good thing obviously we keep doing it despite the double-edged nature of Technology it has a lot of benefits health and Medicine communication transportation agriculture and energy industry it has solved a tremendous amount of problems it is generally a foregone conclusion that technology is good for the human race and that progress that technological progress is generally a good thing but one thing that we need to be aware of is that it's not a Panacea it does it's not a cure-all it cannot solve all problems and in fact technology often introduces new problems not the least of which is climate change driven by the technology to extract and use more fossil fuels just as a prime example from the Industrial Revolution and then in the information age social media social media was supposed to bring us all together but in in fact it has eroded democracy and proved to be a very divisive force uh in in society and not furthermore it increases anxiety and depression for people that use it so social media is something that is a uh in my opinion social media is uh if we could uninvent it we probably should um okay now what is a Salvation fantasy I'll just read you the definition salvation fantasy refers to the deep-seated human desire or belief in a transformational event entity or breakthrough that will ultimately solve all of one's problems eradicating suffering and lead to an ideal state of existence this com this concept encompasses a wide array of contexts including but not limited to religious narratives many religions around the world have a savior or a messiah narrative and in fact this is what Frank Herbert did with Dune the entire point was to be skeptical of Savior narratives and Messiahs or Deliverance to some kind of paradise or afterlife uh again this is a global thing I know that I used Christian iconography but this is certainly not limited to Christianity fictional narratives Hero Stories great Journeys the promised lands usually rescue narratives and then techno optimism so for instance uh techno optimism is the simple belief that technology is a Panacea to everything and that it will technology will inevitably or likely result in Utopia and then finally mental health so the the idea of Salvation fantasy actually comes from mental health so for people that have survived uh severe traumas or cope with severe depression or other mental health issues there's often what's called a Salvation fantasy which is the idea that if you can just do one more thing or just solve one problem then suddenly you'll be delivered from all of your suffering uh which unfortunately mental illness is not that easy to recover from neither is uh trauma and intergenerational Trauma and so on and so forth but the idea is that there is this hope for the future and this is critical salvation fantasies are about hope it's about saying okay I'm hoping for the alleviation of suffering in the future and so I'm going to cling to this idea that one day things will be better uh but one thing to keep in mind is that it is often an external uh event or person so basically something else will change in my outside world that will then make my life infinitely better whether it you know in the case of uh religious narratives there's you know the the end of the uh what is it the Rapture or whatever that some uh some versions of Christianity believe in and even then not all not all uh divisions of Christianity who believe in the Rapture uh fictional narratives the idea that you know uh the hero goes and seizes the magic sword you know Frodo throws the ring into the uh into the volcano at Mountain doom and then suddenly the war is over and life is better um you know everyone is delivered from the orc hordes uh techno optimism the idea that you know full dive VR and genetic engineering and post-humanism and transhumanism will all result in a better future not necessarily true uh and likewise you know we see this with uh mental health today with the uh the meteoric rise of of legalizing of marijuana and the upcoming all the research being done in the psychedelics the idea is that these natural-based plant medicines will uh you know basically save Society from from mental health and to be fair uh there is plenty of evidence that both of those substances when used correctly can greatly reduce suffering for many many people but that being said life is still hard even if you get rid of those problems life is still hard and that's not to diminish the value of technology and these breakthroughs to help but the idea is that even if they help they will not get you to an idealized state of existence so that is the context of what a Salvation fantasy is so let's talk about utopian narratives as a type of Salvation fantasy so in the in the grand scheme of things salvation fantasies are exist throughout the world and throughout history they have existed for basically in all of humanity utopian narratives are also nothing really new uh from Plato's Republic to you know myths of Shangri-La and everything else we all have this idea of like hey you know if you get to heaven where there's going to be nothing wrong and everything is bliss all the time that is the carrot that is the lure the hope that one day things will be better so there's a few uh characteristics of utopian narratives so post-scarcity and hyperabundance this is something that I talk about a lot uh and so basically the reason that I'm bringing this up is I want to temper your expectations that while I talk about these things uh I also want to urge caution and not really focus on this is going to be a Salvation this is a solution to some problems but it's not going to solve all problems Global Peace and Harmony is another component of Salvation fantasies the idea that we will have the cessation of all conflict is often part of of the idea you see this more in solar Punk narratives where the idea is like oh get rid of the police state get rid of all military everyone lives in a hunky-dory life um this is also true of anarchist fantasies and libertarian fantasies where the ideas like get rid of the state you don't need it but this presupposes that you know you won't need police forces and uh militaries and that sort of thing that you won't need any sort of protection or control or application of force total equality and total freedom uh so again the idea that a Utopia or in order to achieve a Utopia then everyone will be equal forever and that everyone will be completely free forever not saying that these are bad ideals to work towards but the idea is that if you put the cart before the horse it's not going to to go well because one you might just be disappointed right when reality doesn't meet expectations but also you know what they say is that uh the path to hell is paved with good intentions and then longevity and augmentation this goes back to transhumanism and post-humanism the idea that a medical breakthrough will alleviate all of your suffering and to be fair this is something that I hope for um I and many other people struggle with chronic health conditions which it's like oh man I would love it if there was a pill or an injection or something that would make my life physically more comfortable hopefully we'll get there but even if that happens there's still a lot there's still uh uh difficulties in life that we'll talk about more but I just wanted to just kind of unpack what a utopian narrative is now the converse to that is dystopian narratives and so we have lots and lots of dystopian narratives uh you know the end of days uh eschatological myths like Ragnarok Armageddon uh this sort of thing there's uh all the antediluvian myths there's the Bronze Age collapse and all the myths and plays that were created about the Bronze Age collapse so for those that are not history nerds like I and my wife are the Bronze Age collapse was basically uh about 3 200 years ago or around uh 1200 BCE and it was a breakdown of the trade and economies all around the Mediterranean particularly the region between Egypt and Greece uh so one of the one of the causes was uh volcanic eruptions another was the breakdown of access to things like tin which harmed their ability to to even make uh bronze tools which then harmed Agri agriculture there was a few droughts and other famines that happened and so basically what happened for the Bronze Age collapse is that society as everyone knew it came completely unraveled and you entered into like a Mediterranean Dark Ages that took about 600 to 800 years to recover from but the wars and raiding and pillaging and the starvation that happened was so traumatic that they kept and told stories about it and they kept telling those stories to keep the memory of the Bronze Age collapse alive for a thousand years until they could write about it again because literally writing was lost for a while that's how bad the Bronze Age collapse was that's why we can't read linear a and Linear B or they're not complete um and so dystopian narratives or collapse narratives or apocalyptic narratives these are the ways that we make sense of the world um they're also about warnings in memory like I said and coping with trauma so in the 20th century we had World War one and World War II and lots of other conflicts there is a reason that there have been more movies made about World War II than any other single event in all of history this is a human instinct to tell stories about traumatic events to keep that memory alive and to warn people don't do this again now dystopian narratives also project into the future they look back as a way of of keeping memory and and telling stories uh to to transmit lessons across the ages but we also look forward and this is where cyberpunk narratives come in where it's like hey let's look at the failures of of Technology let's look at the misuse of Technology the failures of democracy and the flaws of capitalism and let's project that into the future to warn ourselves about what's going wrong sorry I've meant to advance the slide so this is the Dark Side of technology and that is literally the purpose of cyberpunk that is why it resonates with us from an evolutionary and unconscious level is that it basically takes all the unconscious fears that we have and puts them on the screen in front of you so that you can talk about it that is why we keep talking about movies like iRobot and the Matrix and Terminator is because those are warnings saying if we don't fix it this is a possibility so all these epic movies that we have like Terminator and the Matrix and stuff these are modern myths this is these are the stories that we tell ourselves to make sense of the problems that we see and it's also a way that we can come to cultural consensus about about those problems and say hey let's avoid that let's not go down the dark path and so some of the some of the problems of technology I already mentioned social media a big contributor to mental illness and has also eroded the institutions of democracy uh existential threats created by technology such as uh biological weapons nuclear weapons and now ai so we just keep stacking on existential threats to humanity with more technology excuse me so technology is not universally good it is a double-edged sword displacement and exploitation uh jobs poverty globalism has has some drawbacks it has some Advan some benefits as well military you know building more weapons bigger weapons smarter weapons autonomous weapons these are not necessarily the uses of technology that we would have preferred to see uh you know when Tesla and Marconi invented the radio uh I'm not sure that they could have foreseen uh the use of radio technology to remotely control drones to drop bombs Halfway Around the World and then finally surveillance and manipulation such as the Cambridge analytica Scandal and the social credit system in China these again are the dark side uses of technology and so one thing that it's that is critical to keep in mind at all times is that all Technologies are dual use and that all Technologies are uh can it's how you use it right technology is not intrinsically good or evil it is all in the application of Technology so mental illness so this is one thing that is really critical is that uh mental illness is one of the driving factors one of the many driving factors for a belief in a Salvation fantasy the idea that we can invent ourselves out of a problem uh is not necessarily the truth that being said of course you know you can Invent Yourself into problems and you know you might not be able to invent yourself out of it and so what I mean by that is the example of petroleum for uh Transportation yes it Advanced uh the human civilization uh tremendously in the 20th century as the Industrial Revolution ramped up but we invented ourselves into that problem and maybe we can invent ourselves out of that problem by getting to the next level such as solar infusion and that sort of thing but those might introduce new problems and so uh one point here is that maybe we actually need less technology in our daily lives I'm not saying that we need to like all become luddites and troglodytes and you know burn all the technology down but what I mean is that for instance uh people who use their phone less have demonstrably better mental health and a better Outlook in the world which is why I use digital Wellness apps on my phone so you know like yesterday I used my phone for a grand total of an hour there are some days that I use my phone for a grand total of 15 minutes and guess what I definitely feel better on those days so even though the phone your smartphone is a very very useful piece of technology it comes with its own risks and so then I just want to have like one particular point is that no matter how good your external situation is even if you live in the prettiest place on the planet and you're surrounded by friends and family and you have food security and you're in your physically safe the best day in the world does not matter if you have a severe mental illness because that can turn the best day day into ashes um whether it's trauma anxiety depression loneliness dysmorphia and the list goes on and on and on and so the point is that technology will not solve mental illness on its own this is this is the this is the primary struggle that many people have and uh this is one of the key things about the false promise of utopian narratives or salvation fantasies is that you're offered one solution that is not the actual solution that you need and we'll get more into that later in the video all right so a lot of people have asked me to do fdvr videos uh and I've been resistant to it because I personally see fdvr as a kind of Salvation fantasy specifically it's an Escape fantasy uh so basically the real world sucks so just go into uh VR which this was uh this was what the movie surrogates was about which was about you know basically full dive VR but in a robot uh robotic prosthetic and then of course Ready Player one is probably the most successful book in movie franchise about this thing uh but the idea is that like using more technology is not necessarily the answer like I said uh people that use their phones you know Americans are near the top globally we use our and I I was this way I used my phone about five or six hours a day uh when I put the the wellness apps on my phone and I had no idea that I was using it that much uh but maybe saturation with VR is going to be the same and worse and another thing to keep in mind is that uh VR is being created and pushed by corporations with a profit motive they do not have your well-being in mind they want they have their bottom line in mind now that's not to say that corporations are intrinsically evil uh because you know they're just trying to make money like everyone else but it does it does elucidate the problem of perverse incentives where if you have uh VR or full dive VR or whatever that gives you a more complete sensorium experience the possibility for addiction is even higher because you know this is a four and a half inch screen and it's relatively low quality and it's certainly not immersive but if your phone that is the tiny little device can be that addictive how much worse could it be if you have you know it basically it's strapped to your face and it is more immersive so you know my my big concern there is just from a biological perspective take business out of it all together and just look at the VR device uh just in on on its own and the way that it completely hijacks the human senses uh because something like 70 to 80 of the information you get about the world comes in through your eyes a good chunk of the rest comes in through your ears and then uh the rest is tactile and orientation such as proprioception uh but you know VR fdvr takes care of vision uh and orientation because you're moving right so you have some proprioception there's actually scientific evidence that that neurologically when you're in full dive VR or not full diver but even just uh VR as it is today your sense of proprioception changes you actually feel like you are in that environment uh and so VR as it is already gets you most of the way there to just transcending into a different uh place so from a biological perspective this is something that we need to take very seriously all right so what are the promises that come from technology today this is not just fdvr this could be Robotics and Ai and everything else first is unconditional love right we've all been aware of replica and other uh basically AI girlfriends and you know I know that there are people that use uh there are plenty of women that use it on the same side but I think on balance more men oops sorry more men are interested in AI girlfriends than women are interested in AI boyfriends and there are of course people that are homosexual uh using it as well but numerically speaking I think that the desire for men to have ai girlfriends is probably stronger uh now you know the that that promise of unconditional love uh is kind of dangerous because that is basically hijacking a very basic Primal human need if that is going to be provided by a for-profit corporation can you see the problems there uh it could make you uh basically beholden to that Corporation what if the corporation holds your girlfriend hostage and that you know I saw jokes on Reddit and other places like you know what if they add microtransactions to your AI girlfriend and that basically holds you emotionally hostage uh and then of course there's other concerns like is this a real relationship is it going to make you actually worse at real relationships there is some anecdotal evidence that uh having an AI partner is actually good for your mental health and actually can teach you to be a better person to teach you to communicate better there's certainly been some comments on my own YouTube videos where um someone says like oh yeah like chat GPT helped me learn to communicate with my wife better great not everyone does that there is a dark side to this where some people are just so uh bitter and jaded that they just abuse their AI girlfriends right they use it to take out their anger on an AI girlfriend and it's like I don't know that that's healthy but I'm also not here to judge because maybe there is some catharsis there not sure it needs to be studied more but my point here is that the salvation fantasy of you know one day you will have a an AI girlfriend or a robot girlfriend that loves you unconditionally like a dog does um this is I say fantasy like it's a very real possibility that it will exist but it comes with risks and it comes with strings attached that's my that's my primary uh message here so another one infinite Adventure uh basically your AI uh you know friends will be ready to take you on the coolest adventures and you know you're you're gonna have the the sexy Squad that is just whatever right they're ready to go at all times we already see this with video games right like I was playing Gears of War 5 and it's like oh cool you got some you got some cool friends and you're going on a grand epic adventure this is going to become even more realistic with uh VR and full dive VR now for those of us that are struggling with disability and burnout and those other things we physically cannot go on those kinds of Adventures as an autistic person travel is very very hard for me airports are basically the worst thing in the world because they are overwhelming uh they they have too much stimulation there's too much pressure they're very very uncomfortable um you know so like even even though I have the money the ability to travel I still choose not to because traveling is so miserable for me so while I look forward to the ability to go on these Grand adventures with VR and full dive VR I am also constantly aware of the fact that it is not real it is a synthetic experience not unlike going to the movie theater now one thing to consider here is what if VR these VR experiences become preferable to reality and then people want to stay in VR longer and longer another question is does it have the same depth richness and impact as the real experiences and then of course there's you know loss of Interest loss of physical health that sort of stuff again I'm not saying that this is not going to happen I'm not saying that it is a false promise but I'm saying that this is a very powerful carrot that is going to pull you in and give whoever provides that experience to you power over you that is what I that is that is the warning I'm issuing here is that those who provide this VR experience will have that kind of uh influence and control and power over you belonging likewise as AI NPCs become more more uh realistic it's going to be more than just you know like your AI girlfriend it's going to be an entire array of AI friends that are just ready to go on whatever adventure and they accept you as you are provide companionship and again as an autistic person I have very few people in the world who actually get me so the idea is like wow wouldn't it be cool if I had AI friends that I could talk to On My Level about the things that I care about and go on the adventures that I want to go on and but that is super super egocentric um and you know are these superficial relationships are they real relationships are they parasocial relationships the thing is is once it's real enough your brain might not be able to tell the difference and so if it is real enough to you what does it matter uh now you know on the on the on the positive side this could fulfill some very basic intrinsic uh human needs for connection uh another possibility though is that because it it could be designed to be very egocentric it could make you wait worse at real relationships it could make you better at real relationships personally I think it would be interesting to have uh some realism uh coded into your NPC friends uh where it's like you know they're not going to agree with you at all times right they're going to push back and say you know what like I actually don't like it when you do that uh maybe those kinds of things could be built in so that even if you do spend a lot of time in VR you get better at real relationships I don't know uh but my point is is that again it's a dual-use sword uh or a dual use technology or double-edged sword sorry and then the highest thing and this is something that that I even talk about a lot like the idea of using AI to replace functions of government or even to eventually replace politicians I don't know if that's actually going to happen I just threw that out as a possibility just so that we can talk about it right my goal here is to move the Overton window but the idea that AI could come and save us from ourselves this is the ultimate utopian salvation fantasy where the idea that we don't trust humans humans are garbage let's build a digital God to save us from ourselves this is also an abdication of responsibility saying I can't fix the mess that I made someone else fix it for me which to be fair this is true a lot of times in life we we often hire help to fix messes you hire a lawyer to fix a legal mess you hire a mechanic to fix a car mess you hire a doctor to fix your health mess right this is what we do we Outsource our help to fix things for us but the idea is that if you hold this in your mind even at an unconscious level if you have this if you have this belief that one day a digital savior or a digital God will materialize to save Humanity from itself you might be disappointed uh because this is basically the promise of Salvation and it might be a false promise uh now that being said I'm not gonna I'm not gonna for a a heartbeat say that Ai and Technology will hurt us more than it will help us I believe that it absolutely could on balance in the grand scheme of things help us far more than it will hurt us because again social media is dependent on the internet and on balance I think the internet is by and large a good thing but you know while the internet can be used for sharing news and and scientific research and communicating that sort of stuff it can also be used to transmit memes and plan you know coup attempts and that sort of stuff so uh basically be mindful if you do have the Salvation fantasy be mindful if you do have this utopian narrative and that you are hoping for and expecting a digital savior it may happen it might not probably won't at least not anytime soon uh but yeah so just something to keep in mind and I've talked a lot about false promises so you know basically you know I mentioned social media a few times but the narrative so here's here's the narrative that exists particularly in Silicon Valley but it also exists around the world is basically just trust us everything will be better once we solve just one more problem by inventing another Gadget or Gizmo this comes from Silicon Valley the move move fast and break things mentality not necessarily good for society not necessarily good for mental health this is also marketing 101 bait and switch I make you one promise and then give you something else the idea is I promise salvation but then I just give you a product that has microtransactions that's not actually salvation this is actually one reason that uh yeah if you want to be very disillusioned particularly with the West take a course in marketing and advertising and learn to recognize all of the psychological tricks and tactics that they use uh basically anytime you see a pretty person in an ad it's basically saying if you buy this good service you will be associated with these pretty people or you know if you're lonely then you know look at all these friends laughing and and having you know apparently this is mostly an American thing because I think that uh advertising that like that is banned in Europe I'm not sure so what do you do instead instead of buying into these salvation fantasies and these utopian narratives doubt but dream uh be skeptical of any of these Grand narratives whether they are dystopian or utopian some people use dystopian narratives to tap into that nihilism to tap into the hopelessness and despair to push their own agenda right because you can use the carrot or the stick you can use Utopia or dystopia for pretty much the same thing which is basically corralling and hurting people towards certain conclusions and if it's a corporation or government doing those things they're hurting you towards the conclusion that they want you to believe in which is if it's a corporation just buy this just buy this product and then your life will be better if it's a if it's a government if it's a politician they're saying vote for me and your life will magically be better uh now without that critical mindset you might fall into that place of Blind Faith and misplaced Trust our ability to imagine a better future can be weaponized against you uh societal transformation takes a lot of hard work and everything from ending slavery universal suffrage and seizing the means of production have all been those utopian narratives of those salvation fantasies that that if you just solve this one problem everything will be infinitely better but it has never been true and it will never be true uh that yes technology can solve problems one by one but there is no there's not going to be any single transformational event that suddenly makes the world a perfect utopian place yes it will get better but as I mentioned earlier even if the external world is perfect in every way everyone you know like nobody has to work ever again and you get all the food and and internet and every all of your needs are taken care of you might still struggle with mental health you might still struggle with meaningless uh meaning problems and purpose which you know can nullify all of those benefits without exception technology is a double-edged sword it is always dual use meaning that the the pros are counterbalanced by cons there's always benefits and risks uh to out to all new technologies that includes VR that includes AI that includes Quantum Computing that includes space travel right there's all kinds of dystopian ways that space travel could be used what if all the billionaire Elites just leave Earth and say haha you know you're screwed now there was an episode about uh love death and robots about that and I thought it was hilarious because the cats ended up on Mars and the cat said at the end like what did you expect Elon Musk perfect ending I definitely recommend that episode um now so basically no matter how advanced technology becomes there are aspects of the human condition that it will never touch or that it might hurt right because like uh there's aspects of The Human Experience whether it's again finding meaning finding purpose curing Mental Health these are things that are intrinsically personal now technology can tangentially influence them right if you use social media uh and allow yourself to get addicted to it it will harm your mental health however if you use technology to help mental health like finding resources or like the reflective uh journaling chat bot that I built these are these are technologies that are not addictive to use but they all they will improve your mental health or they can I'm not saying they will they can't make that promise but for instance the reflective journaling tool that I built helps me um yeah so it's all about remembering uh what you have control over and your intrinsic worth but also what is inherently or intrinsically human about life and experience and separating that from those utopian narratives and recognizing those utopian narratives for what they are which is a Salvation fantasy fundamentally it is about hope versus despair whether it's climate change or political nihilism or meaning or anxiety and depression this is all the negative forces and then the Hope The Shining City on the hill is the idea that technology or other salvation fantasies might help us and one thing that I've observed is that some people are incredibly optimistic and some people are incredibly pessimistic it's very very divisive and this is also not the first time in history that that has happened the Industrial Revolution was the same way a lot of people said yes this is going to be great you know we can produce food at industrial scales but then of course there are other people that ended up being harmed the farmers that were put out of work the children that were put in into factories and that were maimed and disabled and killed by unsafe working conditions right so all technological advances uh come with pros and cons as Uncle Ben says with great power comes great responsibility and unfortunately there will be no easy answers to any of this meaning purpose and healing are up to the individual no amount of Technology can fix that for you uh and and even worse the whether it's hope or despair whether you have optimism or pessimism uh those can be weaponized against you and used to exploit uh either your Vote or your wallet or whatever else so be wary of the Doomer narratives be wary of the utopian narrative some people honestly believe that you know the world is completely screwed but the fact they keep broadcasting these utopian narratives or these Doomer narratives basically that shapes the way that people react to everything else and it's like ah well we're screwed anyways so what does it matter I don't know that that's true likewise the promise that AI is going to solve everything for everyone forever also not necessarily true uh the the truth is often uh unfortunately more nuanced more gray and usually actually a little more boring uh right like the the perfect utopian future versus the extinction narrative reality will probably be somewhere in between those two so thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this uh like subscribe etc etc et cetera you know that you know the drill cheers
