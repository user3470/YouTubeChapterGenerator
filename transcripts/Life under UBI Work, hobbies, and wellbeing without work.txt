hello everybody David Shapiro here with another video so today's video is uh by popular demand uh as we talk more and more about artificial intelligence and the potential of Ubi and AI displacing a lot of jobs uh for some people it seems like it's a foregone conclusion that a lot of people are going to be out of work real soon probably for good uh there's more and more Universal basic basic income experiments going on around the world uh and if you didn't see it I have another video called uh post labor economics which kind of talks about more of the macro economic aspects of that but in this case people really wanted to learn about Ubi on an individual level so let's get right in uh just a real quick plug for my patreon before we get in um I do have a patreon and all tiers get you into the private Discord where I am often available to chat with people I also there's two patreon discords so there's the premium patreon Discord which I prioritize make sure that I answer all questions that people send me on patreon if you're in the premium tier and I also do have occasional office hours uh where we just all kind of get in a voice chat together and then I do all uh have a higher tier for one-on-one sessions all right back to the show so first let's set the stage imagine this future scenario every American gets two thousand dollars a month no questions asked starting at age 18 let's also for the sake of this thought experiment assume that Health Care is either heavily subsidized or uh practic for all intents and purposes free if you check out my post labor economics video I talk about how uh AI could lower the cost of of lots of things including Health Care by a factor of 100x or a thousand X in the long run let's also assume that the unemployment rate will be about 70 percent there are some people calling for more some people calling for less but just looking at the number of jobs that are like uh vulnerable to being automated away with AI today my personal estimate is that it's around 70 percent uh let's also assume for the sake of argument that parents get a little bit of Ubi per child but it also tapers per child uh so basically uh you wanna you don't want to necessarily hand out uh as much Ubi for every child because that incentivizes some people to just keep having more children um but on the other hand you also want to ensure that uh you know you incentivize the behaviors that you want to see and so one thing that people are concerned about some people uh are concerned about is population collapse actually this is what we're seeing in places like Italy Japan North Korea uh and other places where the population is actually already slowly Contracting and so you you basically need to incentivize people to have children you need to reward them right now um you get tax breaks uh in the form of uh dependent uh tax credit uh so basically this is kind of like a reverse or not a reverse tax credit but a tax credit in the form of increased income on a monthly basis to help pay for children um let's also assume that GDP growth is going to be something like 15 uh due to AI automation so the idea is that most people aren't working but the GDP is still growing like crazy the stock market is growing like crazy so corporations and politicians there's plenty of wealth to go around so we're basically assuming that a state exists of economic abundance and then also some redistribution oh and there was a question someone was asking what's the difference between this and socialism so the difference between this and socialism is that socialism is about Collective ownership or state ownership so in this case Ubi actually fits within capitalism and neoliberalism because the state isn't owning anything the state is just taxing and redistributing within the existing framework another assumption that we're going to make and I talked about this again in the post labor economics video is uh we're basically going to assume that inflation and deflation are going to be modulated by some of these Market forces uh with things like quantitative easing tax rates and that sort of stuff so we're not going to address that further in this video just assume that prices are stable ish okay so absolute just right off the bat let's talk about budgeting you get two thousand dollars a month uh no further questions asked um the first thing that everyone's thinking is the rent is still way too damn high for this uh you know my my mortgage payment which is you know I bought this house almost 10 years ago so before things went absolutely insane uh my mortgage payment is about twelve hundred dollars a month which is pretty good um but that being said the lowest mortgage payment I ever had was 325 dollars a month for a sixty five thousand dollar uh apartment um so it can be done obviously as demand goes up in certain areas the prices also go up uh but point being is that for most people that's just these numbers probably sound completely ridiculous like it's not going to happen again because again ten years ago the economy has changed a lot inflation supply and demand has changed we're facing housing crunches and recessions and all that kind of stuff stuff so again it's like oh you know you everyone's heard like you know someone uh from our parents or grandparents age like oh you know I pay I put a you know family through college on you know a cashier's salary believe me I am aware that economics change over time we will address uh the housing thing in just a minute I'm just kind of setting the stage as to saying okay we need to figure out a way to get housing into six hundred dollars a month or so for everyone cars are another huge huge expense for Americans um so these are the two biggest expenses for most people so you know for instance I have friends that their car payment is six or seven hundred dollars a month that's insane um you know so you combine that with uh you know let's let's say I had a 600 car payment on top of a twelve hundred dollar mortgage that's eighteen hundred dollars a month leaving 200 a month for everything else that's not gonna fly that's not gonna work um now that being said if we can get uh rent or mortgages back down to 600 a month for most people that leaves Fourteen and if we can get rid of cars that leaves about fourteen hundred dollars a month for everything else and also remember in this hypothetical scenario Healthcare is uh highly subsidized or functionally free for most people okay so housing biggest expense let's talk about housing first because if we can get that under control the whole Ubi thing looks a lot more sustainable and feasible for most people so the first thing is downsizing uh a lot of people are already downsizing tiny houses are all the rage right now Katrina Cottages um that kind of kick-started it because after Hurricane Katrina uh of actually what happened was a few celebrities got together and paid for Architects to design Cottages small houses that were very cheap and easy to build so that people that were affected by Katrina could recover more quickly uh ever that didn't start the tiny house Trend but that certainly put it on the map and people are like oh Katrina houses they're pretty cute because again they paid for um professional Architects to make something that was um sustainable and appealing not just cheap and efficient so demand for smaller houses is creating new markets there's um you know last time I looked up at tiny houses a few years ago there were not a whole lot of options now there are tiny house kits there are prefabs there are all kinds of stuff some of the some of the cheapest DIY like livable tiny houses that I could find were around four thousand dollars which is much much more efficient than you know a two hundred thousand dollar house or a four hundred thousand dollar house you can also get pre-built for around 12K and that's you know starting price you can spend up to 200k on a prefab tiny house um which is still cheaper than you know a half a million dollar uh Suburban house uh one thing one of the biggest problems with tiny houses is that um regulations and zoning laws need to be uh updated uh in many municipalities and jurisdictions a tiny house is not allowed to be the primary residence you can have what's called an auxiliary dwelling unit in many places which is basically you can put a tiny house in your backyard but then you need a regular full-sized house so um my wife and I we're about to downsize but even in the countryside the minimum house size that we're allowed to build is 1200 square feet so it's smaller than my current house but it still doesn't qualify as a tiny house we would love to have built something smaller but uh because of the because the County zoning laws we're not allowed to build anything smaller so in order to accommodate a shift to a Ubi we're going to need different zoning laws or areas that are zoned for tiny houses another option is portable tiny houses such as trailers or van dwelling now lots of people you know there's the van dwelling subreddit there's plenty of influencers on Tick Tock and YouTube and uh Instagram and everywhere else that either travel or live in a van full time or whatever uh this is this is good for some people it can be very cheap you can also spend a lot of money uh pimping out a van or a bus or whatever there are challenges associated with this such as safety where do you stay permanent address it also requires a vehicle which again Vehicles can be really expensive the last thing is micro Apartments so not everyone wants to own their own home or their own land so micro apartments are something that is an option they're increasingly popular but again there's a lot of regulations particular early in America that prevent us from even building tiny uh Apartments usually the smallest studio apartment you can get is around four to five hundred square feet which you know there's nothing wrong with that but those are often in Trendy areas and so even though it's a small apartment they're often very very expensive um so they're not really optimized for being economical that being said as I mentioned as the market demand for these things goes up the pressure for cities to accommodate that and for the the capitalist class for the for the corporations to accommodate that will go up um and again there's lots of experiments going on but there hasn't been a new establishment and so one thing that I want to talk about is in the context of History the American suburbs those were intentionally designed about 80 years ago after World War II um as as the the nation was beginning to urbanize very quickly uh you know all the regulations and patterns and architectural designs and and Municipal layouts that didn't exist the modern suburb the subdivision was a new invention and so the fact we had we invented a new way of living within the last century tells me that we can invent a new way of living again and it probably won't take that long because where there's a will there's a way and certainly necessity is the mother of all invention and we will need to figure out alternative ways of living that are not centered on the American suburb um another option other than downsizing is combining households so this is called co-living or co-housing one there are successful uh co-housing and co-living things around the world in America they're usually actually more expensive because of construction costs regulations red tape and so on and so forth in many cases particularly if you look on on Reddit under the co-housing and co-living subreddits there are plenty of horror stories of very very dangerous manipulative people building these communities so I want to urge caution uh before you get involved in any of those kinds of things now that being said there are uh successful examples in America but there are more successful examples around the world particularly in Europe in various places uh there's Eco Villages which are focused on sustainability uh they're basically like uh Co-op Farms essentially uh now that being said there is uh there's a lot of rising Trends around co-living in conventional houses you don't necessarily need a special Village or a special structure right because that's where the red tape and Regulation and excess cost comes in what a lot of people do is actually just combine finances and live in a larger house and so there is a trend that started a few years ago called mommunes and there's actually services that can help single moms find each other to join forces band together and and combine households uh obviously not everyone is a single mother so that model doesn't work for everyone but you know put it this way uh some of my friends in my 20s uh they got together and rented a large house and so having two or three couples living together or even just a few friends you know three four five friends living together if you combine those incomes and you end up with eight or twelve thousand dollars per month guaranteed income from Universal based income from from combining households you can afford a pretty nice house for that uh and so this is a pretty simple model um but what I will say is that finding the right people can be challenging um certainly there have been there are plenty of cases of people having gotten stuck with toxic roommates or destructive uh Partners or whatever and getting trapped in those situations so we will need to keep in mind that some people are going to be better and safer living on their own certainly plenty of people want want to live that way but that being said the social advantages that come from joining forces and banding together um of course we just got we're on the tail end of the pandemic in which case a lot of people actually were kind of forced into that situation you know we created our little survival groups right it was like The Walking Dead um you know you band together uh so anyways uh whether you downsize or join forces or a little bit of both those are ways that you can drastically reduce uh housing costs uh here in America again the biggest thing is that uh particularly on the downsizing we need to update our zoning laws and regulations to accommodate this but I have no doubt that the the pressure from people to do this will uh will kind of force um the government's hand um all right so Transportation I mentioned you know cars are really expensive and America is a car culture so how do we how do we reduce Transportation costs the first thing is walkable cities so most cities I don't know I don't know about most but many cities in Europe were designed and built and founded long before cars uh and so because of that walkability is kind of intrinsic to a lot of European cities however whoops come back um a lot of American cities uh were designed and built with cars in mind and so because of that a lot of American cities are designed around the car they actually prioritize uh and privilege cards over pedestrians which is super super problematic now that being said there are literally dozens of major projects going on around the world to experiment with new walkable cities uh and then of course there are um you know hundreds if not thousands of smaller experiments uh you know of like Urban revitalization uh the cities near where I live all up and down the east coast in the South um they're they're building walkable areas maybe not the entire city is walkable but some of it is walkable and so this focus on green spaces and walkability um is rising there's a couple of YouTube channels I want to recommend um one is City beautiful and the other is not just bikes these are really great channels they're really informative and they will point out all of the things wrong with American cities um the things that some American cities get right that'll compare American cities with European and Asian cities as well but for instance I've been to Paris and I was surprised at at such a sprawling City I was at the on the at the Cathedral on the hill soccer tour which means Sacred Heart and I know they didn't say it with the right accent um but it's literally parasite to the Horizon you cannot see outside of the city from the middle of the city um but you don't need a car in Paris it's wild and like as an American that was the first time I had been one in a city that big but two in a in a fully walkable city um some of the Metros were fully automated which was really cool because you could go all the way up to the front and look out the front windows um there's buses there's Light Rail and then of course uh you know they have the tgv which is the high speed rail to get outside of the city um anyways point being is that there are lots of these experiments going on and so for people that want to stay living inside of a city if you combine those micro apartments or those co-living situations with walkability that will drastically drastically reduce cost of living from for many people it will take some time to build this up especially since we've got so much invested in being a car culture but ride sharing um and and fully automated cars are coming and actually forgot to create a slide for this but one of the things that a lot of the big auto manufacturers want to do is actually have fleets of Robo taxis and so rather than owning a car you'll just use an app to summon you know you know a Ford or a Chevy or a Toyota or whatever and as uh competition drives down price um I think I did a calculation once that the the total the total annual cost for me if I were to if I were able to switch to a robo taxi based on the hypothetical Rider mile cost would probably be about 600 a year and I'm someone who drives 20 000 miles per year so the possibility of doing rideshares and Robo taxis could drastically drastically reduce the cost of ownership for um automobiles or rather you get rid of the ownership cost and you just rent uh in real time another thing is if you don't want to live in the city because I sure as heck don't want to live in the city I am not a city boy I'm a country boy is what I call coaster Villages and these are starting to pop up they're often just called like tiny house communities or RV communities or whatever but again this is one of the things where uh where zoning laws need to be updated but fortunately these experiments are going but basically think of the Shire think of hobbiton but instead of you know underground houses it's tiny houses and Katrina Cottages uh and and tag along kind of um kind of trailers basically what I anticipate is going to happen is that in cheap rural land a lot of that land is going to end up being used for very very small planned nearly self-sufficient not necessarily fully self-sufficient I'm not saying an Eco Village but rather than having uh these things planned around cars and subdivisions it'll be planned around sustainability and so that what I mean by coaster is someone who decides you know what I'm just going to Coast on Ubi I'm going to be happy with that but I also want to live in the countryside uh you will need things like HOAs uh because you know uh good regulations and good agreements make good neighbors um and so you will need stuff like HOAs still in some of these places but the total cost of living there is going to be much much lower because imagine if your plot of land and your tiny house is about forty thousand dollars total right the mortgage payment on that is going to be like 80 bucks a month or something like that uh maybe well let's say 200 bucks a month you can afford that um that's going to be a tenth of your uh monthly two thousand dollars uh income uh so between these two possibilities walkable cities for those who want the urban living and and Tiny House Villages out in the countryside we can probably accommodate a lot of people very efficiently and very cheaply Okay cool so I think uh oh and also another advantage of these coaster Villages is you don't necessarily need a car uh you know if you live like Bilbo Baggins and and Frodo you just walk to your neighbors it's a tiny little village all right now one thing that a lot of people ask is okay yeah but what you know what if I still want more money what if I'm willing to work what if I'm able to work um what is what are the options going to be so that I can still you know make some money and get by so after doing a lot of research one thing that I found is that local goods and services there's going to be a lot of these that are going to stick around and this is because even if a robot can do it these are these are things that you still prefer a human to do and that most humans will be willing to pay another human to do so the first category is the health and wellness stuff so this includes Fitness coaches personal trainers massage therapists that sort of stuff these are the these are the kind of things that require a human touch or human empathy or at least those are highly preferable so this will be things like Barbers and dentists and massage therapists that sort of thing education tutoring mentoring and coaching these are also things that uh that could be pretty durable against uh being automated away certainly uh some online learning is going to be fully replaced by things like chat gbt excuse me many students are already using chat GPT for Learning and mentoring and tutoring and certainly I mean even I use that if there's something that I want to learn about it is one of the best teaching resources out there because it's interactive now that being said there are still going to be plenty of classes and skills that are going to be better taught by a human because a human has the same abilities and capacities that you do so say for instance you go to a painting class or a cooking class or a carpentry class those are the kinds of things that that you will you will prefer to pay for a human just for the experience of being with other people right another thing is going to be experiences such as performances and entertainment local music stage performances busking um you know those sorts of things are going to be pretty resilient because again we are a social species and so we want that connection with other people uh Ren fairs or think are going to be really popular um and so you know you can go set up your booth and do face painting at a ren fair or or whatever kind of festival or convention you want to go to um caregiving grooming and hygiene these are other things so whether it is child care or elder care or Pet Care those kinds of jobs are going to be very resilient against being fully automated away because again even if you do have a robot that can take care of grandma grandma probably would want to see you rather than a robot unless you don't get along maybe maybe it's better that way but also like your dog right like my dog hates machines right so he would freak out if if a robot showed up to take him for a walk so um you know granted I'll I I work at home all day every day so I don't need pet walkers but some people would other domestic services like gardening Lawn Care cooking cleaning growing and sharing food these are things that will probably persist as well because again local economies circular economies these are rising in popularity and then finally Artisan uh and and Craftsman handmade Goods arts and crafts these are the kinds of things that people will really value and cherish and it's also something that a machine intrinsically cannot do in the age where machines can make all kinds of furniture and mass produce it we still already have Etsy where you can buy handmade clothing and handmade furniture and handmade tools and so the demand is already there and one thing that that can happen of of SP and yes they're more expensive but these are much higher quality goods and they're also much more durable uh so again even if those even if mass-produced Goods become cheaper due to AI there's still going to be a demand for those high quality handmade uh unique goods and arts and crafts now okay so that's local uh goods and services there's also still going to be um online and remote so content creators like me probably gonna stick around um influencers streamers whether it's a lifestyle blog or travel blog or whatever I follow I started following lots of Lifestyle bloggers um usually they're attractive uh women because you know that's just the pattern but I also follow plenty of uh plenty of guys who like build stuff or go on adventures that kind of thing and the reason that I think that these are going to stick around is because even if you have a fully digital Avatar your brain knows that it's fake right some people of course will be plenty entertained by uh you know a digital Avatar but really as a human I want to see another human's experience I want to learn from that human I want to empathize with that person and so content influence streamers you know it's the personality it's the realness the authenticity um even if even if there is some performance associated with it that's what people really want to connect with um crowdfunding platforms like patreon only fans plenty of other alternatives are out there those are going to stick around uh and and so basically the two ways that you can make money online in the future I think are going to be ads and crowdfunding there's also white label services like subscription-based services but that's essentially crowdfunding right let's like you you pay to get in and then you get access to exclusive content game hosts coach coaches and and trainers of various kinds so one of my patreon supporters is actually a a professional online coach and she teaches other coaches and this is actually a really really huge uh Market segment I had no idea how big it was um but again having that one-on-one time with someone where you can say hey this is what I'm struggling dealing with because we're humans we're always going to be struggling with something right um but then like Game host there's paid dungeon Masters that can host uh they can run d d campaigns for you all kinds of stuff is possible online that are intrinsically better done if it's a human that being said there are plenty of people working on using GPT Technologies to automate uh uh you know game hosts and that sort of stuff so some of this is going to be is going to change but a lot of these things again people are willing are are the demand for the human is high enough that people are going to be willing to pay for it uh now on top of making more money on with the Ubi uh there is also a lot that you can do to reduce to further reduce costs obviously the biggest things are housing and transportation we already talked about how to reduce the cost there there's a lot of other stuff that we can do to keep reducing costs in order to make better use of the free time that we have so for instance tool sharing tool libraries um there's actually I didn't realize this but many County Libraries or or um you know City libraries already have tools that you can check out uh and then of course if the demand for that goes up then libraries you know will continue to do that there's also maker spaces that you can join usually with a small fee that give you a space to build stuff and borrow tools circular economics which is you know reusing as much as you can refurbishing stuff we're going to talk about refurbishing more in a future slide uh clothing exchanges clothing swaps other good swaps like one thing that I do is that uh every now and then um I just I have a folding card table and I'll put it out by the road and I just will give stuff away right and so um by just giving stuff away and sharing right you don't even have to worry about um you know bartering or exchanging or buying stuff just giving stuff away and and making use of those um essentially community-based donations sharing Services as well so say for instance um you know you might provide child care for people in your community not necessarily for pay but in exchange they give you food or something right so that goes back to bartering and trading uh DIY skills uh repairing things fixing things uh cleaning up whatever there's lots and lots of value that you can get by learning more skills and thus further reducing costs uh caregiving domestic stuff I already mentioned that okay so let's talk about the psychology of this one thing that people are concerned about is yeah but what do you do for fun what do you do for a sense of Mastery what do you do for challenge if I lose my job you know how do I have any sense of self-esteem so let's talk about the psychology of living under Ubi first we're going to talk about what we're going to use Frameworks for this so first one of the most famous ones is Maslow's hierarchy of needs so if you're not familiar with Maslow's hierarchy of needs it is basically just this pyramid which is color coded like the food pyramid if you're in America but it says you need to satisfy these needs starting from bottom to top so physiological needs include air water food shelter sleep that sort of stuff safety needs which is about you know are you in physical danger do you feel safe at home is is your environment quiet enough are there any you know dangerous smells or chemicals or whatever above that once you have those needs met the next most fundamental need is love and belonging so you need friends you need family you need to feel that human connection and of course we're in a loneliness crisis I think something like 30 percent of young people today don't have a single like best friend which is really horrible and I'm hoping that Ubi gives us more free time to connect with people uh above love and belonging you need esteem self-esteem which is self-respect status recognition that sort of stuff and then finally self-actualization so this is what a lot of people are referring to when they when they worry about okay well if I lose my job what am I going to do I need some kind of self-actualization and so self-actualization is the impulse to become the best version of yourself that is the that is the version to reach your highest level right uh and so these are things that are still going to need to be there and we'll talk about this um in future slides um in terms of how can how can you achieve your best the best version of yourself another framework that I'm a big fan of is what's called TLC or therapeutic Lifestyle Changes this was a model that was developed by Roger Walsh and it is an eight-point framework that talks about how do you make a better life for yourself so the framework is pretty simple pretty straightforward one and this is in no particular order by the way one spirituality so being involved in some kind of spirituality doesn't have to be a mega church or anything like that um you know paganism witchcraft uh Neo Hellenism uh uh all kinds of stuff Norse reconstructionists lots and lots of spiritual Frameworks are kind of becoming popular as uh certainly a lot of us younger people are more Pagan um giving back so volunteering and community service is one of the things that um you know again we kind of alluded to this already in terms of cost reduction but giving back volunteering giving your time is actually a really good way to build up self-esteem it's deeply satisfying um like I said one thing that I love is just giving stuff away and if I had more free time and and uh and energy I would probably volunteer more because I have certain skills and you know honestly uh a lot of the code that I give away because I publish all of my code under under or open source standards to me that is kind of like giving back and it's very satisfying I love seeing the little stars and forks on my GitHub repos time in nature um hiking walking going to the lake whatever this is really important for your physical and mental health I go for a walk pretty much every day at lunch unless the weather is bad or unless I'm sick or too tired recreational activities we're going to talk a lot about recreational activities and upcoming slides rest in relaxation if you don't have to go to work you can spend a lot more time resting and relaxing diet and nutrition we've talked a lot about uh how or we will talk more about how all the free time that you get from Ubi will allow you to do things like gardening but also allow you to learn to cook and spend more time cooking because a lot of people don't have time to cook good meals because they're too busy working and resting and so Ubi with additional free time will help people really improve their diet and nutrition seven exercise and activity so this is like exercising for the sake of exercise um which for me I get that with time and nature because I go for walks um and I also uh like to do other things although I haven't done it as much lately hiking climbing that sort of stuff kayaking uh relationships in connection we already talked about relationships and connection um in Maslow's hierarchy of needs and also you'll see that relationships and connections spending time with friends and family is is common for all psychological well-being Frameworks self-determination Theory this is one of my favorite Frameworks because it is so simple and it kind of encapsulates a lot but it's also not a hierarchy it's you need all three of these at all times um and so the idea is that self-determination theory is this is what is this is what people are intrinsically motivated by these are the intrinsic psychological needs of all humans so first is autonomy um or individual liberty we need to feel like we are in control of our lives and our fate this is absolutely critical for All Humans even humans in collectivist societies there's always a tension between individual needs and group needs um but that's intrinsic to all social species it's about balancing the self versus the group desire for competence and Mastery so this is this has to do with Maslow's top hierarchy of needs which is self-esteem and self-actualization so competence and Mastery the the basically feeling like you're good at something one way to measure this is that we Thrive with what's called optimal stress so optimal stress means that you need some kind of challenge for instance people play Elden ring people play Dark Souls these really frustrating impossible games that I personally don't like but the idea is that you try and fail and then when you finally succeed you feel a sense of Mastery right and of course video games are not the only way to get Mastery but video games are a good way to get a sense of Mastery and as we'll talk about once we talk about Hobbies there are lots and lots of of other ways to get that sense of Mastery finally desire for relatedness and connection as a social species we are intrinsically motivated to seek out connection with others and so by keeping in mind what our intrinsic base needs are and building a life around that we can still maintain our psychological well-being even if we don't have a career at least a conventional career that we're familiar with okay as I promised Hobbies this is the last section of the video and this is honestly where I had the most fun and it made me really realize I am looking forward to this um so I'm gonna do everything that I can to help make this future State come to fruition with my YouTube channel and my open source research so the first thing obviously gaming a lot of you tell me how excited you are for the possibility of fdvr which means full dive virtual reality everyone knows what fdvr is you saw it in the Matrix the idea is that you plug your head in and as far as you can tell it is a hundred percent real we also explored this with um Ready Player one which had like a haptic suits um I don't know if it's possible a haptic suit seems like it's probably more possible in the near term full dive VR such as the what you see in the Matrix might not be possible but you never know people are working on brain computer interfaces so if you can just plug in all the sensory information directly into your head maybe it's possible anyways whatever you want to do whatever experience you want to have should hypothetically be possible with fdvr um a part of gaming is that it can be social right game with friends whether you're competing online with friends uh or you got a guild or a clan that you've built um you can also uh do parallel play in person so this is what um I do with my wife we Heckle each other um while she's playing Assassin's Creed I'll be like hey did you know that you're on fire and she's like yes Dave I know that I'm on fire uh you know parallel play is a great thing to do with friends you can sit around you know I used to do this back in my college days with my buddies drinking a couple beers playing Call of Duty Trolling each other it can be a really great thing and I'm glad to see that the younger Generations do this still my nephew and all of his friends they play Minecraft together and other things um there are what I will say is there are some potential downsides screen time can be detrimental to your health but if you balance it with some of the other things like in the therapeutic Lifestyle Changes make sure that you go outside touch grass as kids are saying these days um it can also be addictive and isolation as possible I do suspect that we will see legislation coming that kind of at least provides warnings for how addictive things are there's a book that I refer to often called liquid rain where they talk about how uh full dive VR could actually be programmatically addictive like where it could just stimulate your dopamine and so you feel like you're having more fun than you actually are and then when you're not in the full dive VR you could you could like physically crave it and get sick if you don't have it so we do need to be careful with um creating gaming as a central lifestyle and another thing is that a gaming world is not necessarily the real world and most people's brains will keep track of that difference and so it might not be good for self-actualization for instance if you're if you're a gamer you might not uh get the sense that you're reaching your full potential that being said if you're a competitive gamer uh maybe that is the way that you reach your full potential making and fixing things we humans evolved to use our hands that is why we have so much dexterity in our hands we are the tool users and so one of my best friends from back in the day is working on rebuilding a thistle so this is a thistle it's a small racing boat we would be doing this all day every day if we had Ubi and no need to uh work for money um because the the shop where he's rebuilding his there's two other ones that are just waiting for someone to come and fix and if I had the time that's what I'd be doing why because it's something that my friend does and you can then race it and do competitive stuff but there's also skill building right the sense of Mastery that you get from building something from fixing it and then having that thing that you can show off and use this is a really great way to get a sense of Mastery there's plenty of other things that people do lots of guys like rebuild Mustangs or Corvettes fixing up old houses and other things so reusing refurbishing fixing building things these are really great ways that also tap into really Primal needs for humans some of the things that are really popular today particularly with young people forging leather working sewing other carpentry all of these things revolve around tool use and so whatever hobby you pick up if it uses tools chances are there's a lot of skills involved which can also lead to that sense of Mastery cooking I mentioned this earlier cooking is one of the oldest trades one of the oldest professions out there and everyone needs to eat plus cooking is a good social activity my wife and I cook together pretty much every day or at least we take turns some people compulsively cook and feed other people my sister-in-law is like that she loves cooking for people point being is that there is there are a lot of hobbies out there that center around making or fixing things outdoor stuff hiking climbing canoeing boating whatever there's all kinds of stuff that we could stand to do more of um if you uh if you had more free time because you didn't have to work because you didn't have to be at a desk or at an office or at the store or whatever um you know and it's not just fishing obviously that's the prototypical example where you know you know a guy gets to retirement age and he decides he's going to go fishing every day not everyone wants to do that I get it um you could do competitive fishing um but there's also other uh kinds of competitive outdoor stuff like cross-country challenges I ran Tough Mudder almost 10 years ago and I was hungover as heck when I ran it I was not hungover by the end of it I burned all that all that uh all that toxins off um skiing kayaking all kinds of really challenging stuff that you can do outside a lot of my friends picked up mountain biking which you could do practically anywhere um uh during the pandemic uh so one thing that I realized when I was making this video is that if if we got Ubi tomorrow um I would probably go hike the Appalachian Trail I love being outside I love being in the mountains and that is something that I want to do but right now my brain is like well I'm still gonna make YouTube I still got to do AI stuff I still have meetings with my patreon supporters so doing the Appalachian Trail is not really an option for me right now unless I were to take like three months off which maybe I should anyways Fitness Fitness is the most familiar model that a lot of people use to get Mastery whether it's yoga or Pilates or running or cycling martial arts uh strength training these are all things that people um many many people do and and it can be a little cultish for some people there's also Fitness based competitions like Iron Man American Ninja that sort of stuff that being said there are many many many additional benefits um other than just you know it's something to do uh better Fitness it leads to reduced pain increased Health uh cognitive benefits emotional benefits plus you get to show off your body right there's lots of people that love being fit just for the sake of feeling sexy right there are so many people that um that I'm that I knew and have met and and where they decided to get fit um you know started climbing started going to the gym and the the the transformation that they felt as they felt better about themselves about their body the sense of accomplishment that they get from that is incredible and still not for everyone so I want to say like okay even if you have all the options in the world and you decide that exercise isn't for you that's fine or or fitness exercises for everyone Fitness might not be for you meetups so I am a huge fan of meetup.com I actually met my now wife at a Meetup um we're both writers um so the the kinds of tools that are out there so meetup.com is there specifically for finding people with the same interests challenges or whatever right uh so meetup.com it's free to join um I tell people about it all the time I think more people should be on Meetup whether um you know you have a special interest or if you've got something that you're coping with there's there's uh support groups um on Meetup I host a local AI Meetup I'm actually going to that later today um let's see there's intellectual kinds of things there's chess clubs there's spirituality uh clubs Arts crafts photography all kinds of stuff whatever your interest is especially if you live in a city you can find other people that have that same interest which is a really great way um to get those that's that social connection but then also some of these things can lead to senses of Mastery for instance all right so this is life under Ubi uh I hope that you got a lot out of this um and like I said making this video actually I kind of clarified a lot for myself and it makes me personally a lot more excited for the future and I'm personally this was probably the most fun that I've had making a video uh yet so anyways cheers
