hey everyone David Shapiro here with a weekly update for project Raven but before we jump into that I wanted to um share this with you guys so Nvidia is a company that I'm working with public information we had a my startup had a press release that we're in the Nvidia Inception program and I saw this article just now and I said yes we need to talk about this so Nvidia predicts that AI models one million times more powerful than chat GPT will be here within 10 years and this is why projects like Raven are so important so the tldr is that as uh neural networks get bigger they get deeper more training data we get better optimizations so on and so forth and as also the underlying Hardware is getting better really quick so you look at the way that things are scaling up and it just goes keeps going this is why I am confident when I say we will be facing 70 unemployment by 2030 because you think of how useful chat GPT is right now imagine chat gpt2 three four five six versions later with Hardware that is 10 000 times more powerful on models that are ten thousand times more sophisticated this is coming and it's coming fast so with all that said thank you let's talk about how to make sure that once artificial general intelligence and then artificial super intelligence and Global intelligence whatever you want to call it as it's coming how do we make sure that it's safe how do we make sure that it isn't going to kill us all and that it does what we want etc etc so there's a few components of this problem one is just the software how do you write the code how do you even generalize the principles of intelligence into code into language so that a machine can do it so that is that is the first PR uh problem of developing a cognitive architecture like Raven and so if you're new Raven is my open source project for creating an artificial cognitive entity or autonomous cognitive entity that's actually what we're pivoting to Ace autonomous cognitive entity is a machine that can think on its own uh indefinitely and ideally will be safe I've written a few books on this topic so on and so forth so that is the purpose of this project and with that I have a whole bunch of stuff code experiments books so on and so forth but as you can see we have 541 Stars 58 Forks uh 69 Watchers what we are working on with this project right now we're on consensus Step 2 to define a consensus policy and so for some background the idea is that something as important as AGI artificial Global intelligence or autonomous cognitive entities whatever digital super intelligence something like this is entirely too important for it to be developed entirely behind closed doors so one of the chief goals one of the foremost goals of my project is to have the development be completely transparent and as participatory as possible that's what we're working on and so consensus Capital C consensus is a method of inviting more people to the table now we're learning lessons as we go so for instance not everyone is qualified to uh contribute but everyone's voice should be heard and so we're working on the nuances of of that so for instance one of the tools that we're looking at is using chialo so I did a test uh chialo here where it's basically like you have a you have a problem you have a few proposals and then you pick apart those proposals and so this is a way of organizing and formalizing debate I don't know if this is the way that we'll go certainly not in public not fully in public we're working through the process of consensus so we're basing it on a book called consensus through conversation which is has a five-step process five or six step process um and we are on step two which is set the decision criteria which is a list of criteria that whatever proposal you end up coming with uh or coming to or decision that you come to these are the criteria that must be met in order for it to be considered successful so I use gpt3 to summarize all the conversations into a list of must-haves nice to haves and must not haves and people seem to like that summary so we have we have some boundaries for our consensus policy that we're working on so then the question is okay why what do we use consensus for consensus will likely be used for making architectural decisions on how to deploy Raven so this will be things like you know what kind of containers to use what kind of cloud services to use um the the definitions around you know release one the MVP release two that sort of thing it probably oh we'll also use it to make decisions around like what communication channels should we use should we use like a shared Google Calendar should we use you know Discord or slack or whatever it probably will not extend into the full governance of of the whole Raven project so my startup is is almost certainly going to own the the product the overall process um we're talking with various uh potential investors and customers um in order to figure that out talking to the CTO of my startup we will probably or at least where we're looking right now is we will probably uh professionally code the Nexus service and the conductor service and then as once we establish all those guidelines all the all the standards all the apis and the deployments and stuff then as there's as there's a common framework then everyone else will be able to contribute microservices as they wish and we'll probably have templates so that if you have an idea for a micro service that you want to create you can just copy a baseline repository throw it in and it'll have all the all the you know basic authentication and other Telemetry Bells whistles and knobs and levers that you need to get started but we will probably own fully owned the Nexus and the conductor maybe a couple other Baseline Services we'll see that's the direction that we're going right now um so it is getting organized it is coming together my startup is also uh we're in crunch time for releasing our first product so that's why again uh uh progress is slow but this is also part of consensus too something this important deserves the time that it's going to take so with all that said we are in the middle of step two of consensus this time next week next Friday we will uh call um consensus step two we'll bring that to a close and then we'll start workshopping the actual proposal uh for our consensus so I'll probably draft something a bunch of other people will contribute and we will get to something where um you know the community will vote on it so that's where we're at those are the stakes and thanks for watching
