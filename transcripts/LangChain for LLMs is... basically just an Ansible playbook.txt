foreign okay this is going to be a spicy take but um and this is also not a criticism of Lang chain because they are new right it's a 0.0.75 um as a sis admin I am not impressed by Lang chain and I know that a lot of people that are coming from the AI and ml place are super impressed by this but this is fundamentally just a Playbook or a run book and so what I mean by that is it is a it is a configuration of tools that allows you to create um a workflow a very simple workflow so you know you can choose an llm you can choose you know a few um like tools to go reach for and then you can chain them together and then it can make some choices as it goes but guys this is an ansible Playbook this is this is ancient history for CIS admins like like yes ansible is not like native to uh uh to to language models yet but in terms of like configurability and reaching out to API endpoints and automation Lang chain is basically an ansible play book that is language model Centric first now that being said ansible is incredibly powerful for automation for process automation it's also really super simple uh like it's yaml it's super human readable uh so I'm super not impressed by Lang chain they should probably move to yaml copy success right where if you want a run book just go ahead and just go ahead and copy you know old stuff that works yaml Json probably um it's also like so then here's the other thing that is super not impressive uh to me is that okay you've got a run book great don't care uh it's been done um you need a lot more stuff so it needs to run in loops and it also needs to run in parallel because what Lang chain does if you look at ansible Tower which is it's just this part like you need the rest of this architecture before Lang chain is to me useful or compelling um so if anyone from Lang chain wants to talk to a veteran sis admin and a veteran automation engineer my name is Dave shop automator uh happy to talk to you uh but yeah so like you've got the playbooks that's great it's a start but then you need rules you need triggers you need data collection you need monitoring like you need a full platform and I'll talk about a couple of Open Source platforms that are uh good Alternatives that you could integrate with um but basically what I mean by a workflow or a run book is this is a graphical representation of of a lang chain or a language prompt chaining um this is the same as this this is just a yaml uh definition of something like this and this is nothing new process orchestration has has been around for a while so here's another example of a graphical process uh orchestrator or workflow orchestrator uh engine which again like this is nothing new workflow or a business business process orchestrators and and automation orchestrators have been around since like at least the 90s so again like we don't need to reinvent the wheel which is why I'm I have not been impressed by Lang chain yet because it's basically Reinventing the wheel for stuff that has existed for literally decades in some cases it's just for language models um and so what I mean by that let's let's go through this so like um you know some of the some of the stuff like okay uh we can do we can do agents um actually where did it go uh okay so like chat Bots you know like where you've got a little bit of memory and variables you can pipe in um oh yeah templates so like you know you piping in templates and saying okay grab this like this has all been done before um so oh here's another example of node-based workflows um this is from blender right and so the biggest problem with all this is that even if you have choices even if you have if you can design a workflow that's like okay get to a decision point and then picks pick you know a b or c or even if you have 20 options right it's still an intrinsically linear workflow it does one thing which means that you need to do it by hand manually that is not the correct way to use language models you need to use the language model to design this whole thing that is what I am working on that's what I wrote about in Symphony of thought which is let's break down the process of creating tracking and completing tasks and have the language model do all of it so I'm not really interested in hard-coding workflows which is why I'm like I don't really care about uh uh uh Lang chain now that being said if Lang chain gets to the point where it can dynamically compose tasks and track tasks that would be great so there's two platforms that I want to introduce you to one is stackstorm so stack storm is like an open source alternative to uh ansible Tower and so one of the one of the huge benefits of stackstorm is that you have event triggers and there's all kind there's like web hooks there's timers there's all kinds of ways that you can trigger these and then uh there's rules that they can follow in terms of uh what runs when what it connects to and so on and then then you trigger the workflow right the set of instructions this is the uh just that's all that that's all that Lang chain does is okay you have one workflow so what you need to do is you have to have a bunch of different workflows that can be dynamically modified and dynamically kicked off with those um deep chains uh and then of course there's the actual final action the final output that comes from it uh and then of course uh stack storm like ansible has plenty of Integrations with all kinds of things whether it's databases cloud service providers servers networks you name it it has the integration another one is run deck which I have used extensively because rundex a little bit simpler than stackstorm but run deck is uh it's it's basically the same thing where you've got a really good web GUI so here's an example of the web GUI and then you've got jobs you've got nodes it can be decentralized it stores the data and the results and can go talk to databases or whatever so anyways uh yeah I I do appreciate when people say like oh you should use Lang chain but from assist admin perspective langchain is ultra primitive so um if I were to if I were to use an existing um project for a cognitive architecture it would almost certainly be stack storm because it is an automation engine right Lang chain is an is a is a workflow orchestrator uh or a run really it's just a run book provider and a runbook provider is just a tiny component of a fully fledged cognitive architecture what you need is parallelism you need triggers you need rules and then you also need to collect and store that data in a really meaningful way so with all that said I do appreciate it uh it's it's it's a there they'll get there put it that way they'll get there but as of right now I'm not particularly interested in Lang chain if I were to put in the energy I would like I said I would use stack storm or run deck and then just build all the functions in here because you can just run python functions out of either of these um and then pull data you can pipe data in which these these two engines have pretty sophisticated ways of populating variables um and then from there you create very granular uh workflows or run books and then you call them dynamically to perform individual cognitive functions um but this is not this is not there yet it's not quite sophisticated enough so with that said I'm rambling I'm repeating myself thanks for watching I hope this was valuable if anyone from langchain wants to reach out feel free um but yeah number one lesson copy success ansible stack storm run deck they already have this figured out
