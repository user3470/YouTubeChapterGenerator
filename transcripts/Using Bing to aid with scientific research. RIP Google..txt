hey gang David Shapiro here um I'm actually doing some some research with uh bing and so since Bing is new and not everyone has access to it yet I wanted to share so for some background um as many of you know I am Nero spicy and I remember reading a article a few years ago about how neurological signals propagate differently across the brains of people that are neurodiverse now I'm going to see if I can find this with Bing um so I I switched over to chat and it's like okay sure blah blah blah blah I use the wrong term neural leakage which apparently has to do with uh blood brain barrier and other inflammation Etc et cetera so I used the wrong term so I said I think I used the wrong term I was trying to find a scientific article or paper that talked about how some individuals with ASD and or ADHD and other forms of neurodiversity have atypical signal propagation in their brains can you help me find such articles um uh to clarify if needed um or just find some papers thanks all right so let's see if it'll help since I asked for scientific papers I hope that it doesn't get offended okay it doesn't look like it's going to cancel it a typical neural signal propagation ASD ADHD so it looks like what it does is part of the steps is is it kind of simplifies the Search terms to the most relevant um let's see one article that might be relevant is oscillatory neural networks underlying resting state attentional control and blah blah blah okay this article suggests that asdna are associated with distinct alterations and large-scale oscillatory networks which are groups of neurons that fire rhythmically together these alterations May underlie the neurocognitive atypicalities in these disorders yes that is probably relevant so that's all cited in citation one and citation two another article that might be of interest ADHD and ASD distinct patterns of inhibition related activity the inhibition related activation during go no-go task so a go no-go task is when you're waiting and you're trying to like have a Flinch response to like push a button or not um this article investigates brain activation patterns related to inhibitory control which is the ability to suppress unwanted impulses or actions the authors found the children of the ADHD showed reduce activations in regions okay that's may may not be as relevant the Monash autism ADHD genetics and narrative element um the article suggests the project aims to identify common genetic variants I hope these articles help um I think the first article is the most relevant so here's the search query I'm wondering if these atypical signals in the brain might also have anything to do with synesthesia and or certain types of neurogenic tinnitus for instance I've had multi-tonal tinnitus my entire life which indicates to me it could be genetic um or endogenous rather than um and injury or disease um so I'm curious if perhaps the tones I hear are actually neural signals leaking into my auditory neurons um obviously I am not asking you to diagnose uh anything just looking for Relevant scientific uh literature okay so let's see if it'll do that it might not Bing is pretty sensitive um and it'll would not be surprised if it uh ends the conversation okay a typical neural signal synesthesia and tinnitus um so let's see what it does it's thinking I understand you're wondering Okay blah blah synesthesia is a condition okay it's kind of talking through yes I know it can be inherited or acquired um and is more common in people with ASD okay I didn't know that so that's interesting so tinnitus is common in neurospicy people um the exact neural mechanisms are unclear but some studies suggest it could be involved increased connectivity or cross-activation between different sensory regions yes yes that's what I was looking for okay so we're looking for um well here let's check out these let's see tinnitus is a perception of sound with no external sound sources present can be caused by various factors such as damage to the inner ear exposure loud noise aging medications or neurological disorders can also be associated with synesthesia where some people experience visual or since tactile Sensations along with sound yes I used to um if I'm really tired I still get the the um tactile Sensations where it actually has a grading feeling um it's super unpleasant um okay so yeah it looks like it looks like I remembered correctly and Bing was able to help me find some of this stuff um let's see the neural mechanisms of tinnitus a perspective from functional fmri Imaging from Zhang at all the article reviews how functional magnetic resonance imaging um which measures brain activity based on blood flow changes Okay blah blah okay so anyways long story short um it looks like Bing is actually pretty good the fact that it can cite sources in a line is super powerful um I'm actually really happy with this because this is something that I read like years ago and I've just kind of revisit this idea every now and then and so uh as as you're probably familiar with trying to find scientific papers on the internet can be a real pain so this is this is pretty incredible um and I think it says three of six because that's how many uh responses we get I'm hoping that bit that Microsoft is able to to keep Bing um on track speaking of folks at Microsoft I know you're watching this if you want any help just let me know um happy to happy to jump on a call with you guys and provide some advice anyways we'll call it a day there um I'm gonna read some of these articles and figure out what's wrong with my brain all right talk later
