morning everybody David Shapiro here with your weekly video So today we're going to talk about the data flywheel the number one concept you need to know in the age of AI right off the bat what is a data flywheel in short the concept of the data flywheel is a simple virtuous cycle whereby you have users and you use those users to get more data you use that data to get better AI you use that better AI to get better products and services which in turn gets you more users and more data and so on and so forth and on into Infinity you get compounding returns and exponential growth so um I had to make this on my own graphic because I think most of the ones out there are probably copyrighted and I didn't want my video to get taken down but if you just Google image search data flywheel you'll see what I'm talking about there's plenty of good articles out there but let's Dive Right In okay so history of the flywheel turns out that flywheels are actually like super old like 8 000 years old um most of the time they're used for pottery wheels sharpening sticks and stones but basically it's this little bit down here that heavy Stone right and so what you do is you spin it and hold some of that energy and it'll keep spinning and you add more and more energy and it speeds up over time so that's kind of where it started uh but the concept of the flywheel applies today uh just as much as ever so flywheels are part of engines uh particularly large diesel engines but also uh flywheels are really important for things like race cars pretty much any electromechanical device or chemical mechanical device because it Smooths out the performance and and helps conserve some of that rotational energy some of that power but in all cases they start at zero and they have to speed up you can even have really big flywheels act as generators for when you lose power so all right so now you know what a flywheel is electromechanical device or chemical mechanical device that stores rotational energy sure you don't care about the physics of it where did the data flywheel begin um so apparently the whole thing was pitched to Jeff Bezos back in 2003 by Jim Collins um and then of course everyone's familiar with the Silicon Valley or are they in Silicon Valley anyways the the the tech darling of Amazon right Jeff Bezos has obviously been incredibly successful and Amazon has pioneered and championed all sorts of innovative things such as agile microservices continuous deployment continuous Improvement the data flywheel idea is one of the foundational principles of Amazon's success which is I don't understand why people more people don't know that that's why I'm making this video so now you know um okay so generative AI is basically a fire hose of data every inference that you send to uh gpt3 gpt4 uh for image generation every single thing that you send and get back is more data it's literally just a data producer it's a fire hose of data and so you should record every single inference or generation for LM image generators everything save it all save the input the output the context the metadata the parameters everything so there is so much data going on here and this is above and beyond the existing data that you get from like your insights and Telemetry from uh from your applications in web right because everyone by now is familiar with the fact that like uh you know linger time time on page uh all those other data points are available through things but now you have even more data which is your product is more directly related to your data your products and services so there's lots and lots and lots of data to consume already but then there's even more data to consume in the age of generative AI so how did I use this so I use this to go from 20 000 subscribers at the beginning of this year to over 50 000 subscribers right now so I more than doubled my subscriber base in just a few months now obviously some of that is algorithmic luck right some of that was I noticed a trend and I made use of it but that was consuming the data so let me tell you how it wasn't entirely on accident for those of you who don't know YouTube gives you a dashboard for creators and some of the information that it gives you it's it tells you one which of your videos are doing best over time it tells you which uh channels and other videos are leading to yours so you can see okay who are my peers and competitors I don't really think of it as a competitive landscape because usually users want more of the content that you give them so it's more like peers right we're all offering similar similar content it's like a buffet um so it's like okay so they're they're doing this they're doing that um and there's a lot of information that you can consume above and beyond what the dashboard gives you so there is a service out there called vid IQ which I tried and I didn't like it um I didn't I didn't go for the paid tier but I was just like I saw like I was looking at the dashboard and I was like oh they're obviously using like an llm to generate some recommendations I was like I can do better than this so what I did was I took the transcripts from my own videos and I compared that with the comments that I was getting so I I took the transcript and comments and I said what about my videos is resonating with my users and so I use chat GPT to distill down and said okay this is what people like this is why and then I use those insights to generate um ideas for follow-up videos and to really kind of shape my narrative and delivery and it worked I got from 20 000 Subs to 50 000 Subs in just a couple months that was uh how I really kind of nailed the algorithm them by using this data flywheel because more users more subscribers meant that I got more data right and the data in this case was in the form of comments but also the the numerical Telemetry right because you put out more videos you see which videos resonate which ones don't and I feed that into the AI in this case chat gbt which led to better videos better transcripts or Scripts which led to more users um so that's just I did it by hand right didn't just manual copying and pasting of of raw data into chat GPT obviously this is not the most sophisticated or sustainable model but it's just an example of how easy it is to get started with the data flywheel so with this concept of the data flywheel the goal the business goal is compounding Returns the positive feedback loop The Virtuous cycle or most conventionally The Snowball Effect because the more subscribers you have the better reach you have the more data you've got and that's just for YouTube this applies to every business out there whether it's for your marketing team your product team everything so how can businesses do this obviously not everyone out there is a YouTube Creator so you're like Dave come on get on with the show so there's a few rules of thumb um out there so one record everything if you're not recording your data you need to be recording it and not just the output from the models you need to record what goes in and out because that's how you're going to get the feedback later you also need to record the metadata the metadata the context and the parameters because that information will be critical with for making sense of the data later on number two you need to actually use the data there are so many companies out there that have a lot of data that they just never even look at so then they're spending money on storage and backups and they're not using it you might as well just delete the data if you're not going to use it number three and this is the hardest part is make changes pretty dashboards and charts and graphs don't mean a damn thing if you don't actually change your behaviors so sometimes that means you need to say hey like this email campaign didn't work let's just stop doing it or you know we're we're totally missing out on this sector we need to go after that sector you can change your outward Behavior which is how you engage with the market and your customers you can also change your internal Behavior so in the age of language technology that can be changing how you run and use meetings it can change it can be how you uh use jira and slack and teams and all that stuff so you have to change your behaviors your rules your structures change the system right and if you don't do that if you're if you if you just consume the data and look at it but then don't make any changes again you might as well just delete it and I'll tell you why that's the worst decision you can make in just a minute and number four iterate you're not going to get this right the first time right you're going to experiment you're going to have a lot of uh of uh false starts a lot of damp squibs that just it just doesn't hit but then when you do nail the algorithm you'll go you'll do what I did which is go from twenty thousand Subs to fifty thousand Subs in just a couple months and that's that's honestly the dream of every tech product out there right that's what chat GPT did they kept iterating on GPT technology until they found the version chat GPT that went to 100 million users in a couple of months all right so I'm talking about iteration and all this other stuff in data flywheels and you've probably never heard about either of these things but the good news is for all you business types out there there are a few Frameworks out there that you can just go read about and hire a consultant and uh and say Hey I want to improve my business processes both internally externally uh customer product whatever and you say I want to do this from a data Centric perspective because this is the age of AI so first one is agile agile is a software uh development thing which focuses on tight feedback loops so that is agile is how you can do the data flywheel for your your software teams Kaizen is about iterative Improvement more broadly across your whole business Six Sigma is a very similar thing where it focuses on reducing defects um and and flaws in the process and then finally I till the it infrastructure Library um is about service process Improvement internally so all of these read a book or two on it you'll see the common thing the what these all have in common is rapid feedback loops and those feedback loops are often human-based processes but there's no reason that you can't start adding more data and consuming that data with AI to get that feedback and make those Behavior changes all right so I know some of you guys are hot on the biscuit to get going so for all you business Chads out there like cool your britches for a second so while a data flywheel is really critical like if you want to survive in the age of AI you absolutely 100 need a data flywheel I guarantee you that uh 80 or 90 of the businesses that fail in the age of AI won't have a data flywheel that being said this isn't this alone isn't going to save you right um doing the if you say like hey we need to do a data flywheel before you even have a product you're missing the point you need a decent enough product or service first to prime the pump right if you if you look at that graphic where you start with more users right I've already got users on my YouTube channel I earned that the hard way right if your product doesn't have any users data flywheel isn't going to matter because remember the data flywheel is based on inertia it's based on momentum if it's sitting there inert it's actually going to slow you down more um it's not an it's not a shiny new toy it is nice but as a business person you shouldn't even be thinking about it once it gets set up let your teams handle it because they're going to be the ones to to know how to do it um most importantly that concept all these philosophies of iterative improvements start with executive leadership if you don't buy in on a on a visceral level and understand process Improvement and iterative Improvement at an executive level doesn't matter you might as well not even do it all right so in order to really power up obviously eventually you're going to want really fat fat data pipelines to feed your uh flywheel right there's a few mantras that you can adopt and this is for executives all the way down to engineers and product owners and Architects data is the new oil it baffles me how few people have heard this term in the age of generative AI data is the new oil um live it learn it embody it embrace it think about it talk about it another one is slow is smooth smooth is fast this is the idea of kick starting your data flywheel slowly at first remember it's a big heavy thing right all your products all your services all your data it's really cumbersome you're not going to light this fire real fast you got to start slow that'll be smooth but the idea is that it cranks up over time right it starts accelerating garbage and garbage out for those of you who are not familiar with machine learning and data science if you feed it a bunch of garbage data you're going to get a lot of garbage results so don't put pressure to say like we need to consume all of our data I know that I said record all your data that doesn't mean consume all your data right you have a big pile of data you need to figure out which signals to pay attention to and that goes to the last thing which is what gets measured gets managed this actually comes from ITIL so ITIL talks about things like manage your uh your time to resolution your mean your mttx mean time to resolution and a few other things in your it service Portal same thing can happen for customers right whether it's an internal customer or external customer how long does it take to satisfy customer demand how much does it cost you those kinds of things if you're not measuring the right things you're completely blind and this these are all some of the mantras this is not an exhaustive list but these are some of the mantras that can go into building that mentality of the data flywheel so in the age of AI uh being where oil is the new data stop hemorrhaging your data or your oil because then you're just losing money it's money out the door and that's all there is to it I believe yes that's the end of the video all right thanks for watching
