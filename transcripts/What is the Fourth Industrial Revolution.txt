what is the fourth Industrial Revolution and how did we get here so real quick tldr in a nutshell the fourth Industrial Revolution is the Confluence of several Technologies namely artificial intelligence Automation and Robotics Quantum Computing which of course is still ramping up uh blockchain Technologies and cryptocurrency spatial web and web 3.0 biotech and genetics and finally nuclear fusion now obviously as I mentioned some of these Technologies are still ramping up some of them are all the rage right now but basically these six technological uh domains are going to be what powers The Next Century of human advancement so let's get into it for a little bit of historical context I want to tell you about the previous revolutions and we're going to start all the way back in the Bronze Age so the Bronze Age tldr if you're not familiar start at about 5 000 5500 years ago with the introduction of copper and Tin uh being merged to make bronze so this allowed us to have better tools better weapons it was also associated with other technological improvements such as the invention of the wheel and axle you might you know be thinking of uh chariots that uh that the Egyptians used during Warfare uh but also wheels and axles were used for farming uh irrigation moving dirt around also writing became a really big thing uh around this time so whether it was clay tablets or papyrus writing was used primarily at first for resource coordination and government functions of course writing also eventually was used for storytelling and Records keeping and a few other things but all this really started about 5500 years ago and this period of time lasted for about two thousand years until around 1200 BCE now skipping forward a little bit ancient Rome so we fondly remember the Roman Empire for a lot of things you know a lot of uh scandalous Affairs and Corruption and backstabbing and a lot of really great stories but they're also remembered for their engineering Feats namely around stone working and concrete now above and beyond that because obviously you know the Coliseum is still standing the pantheon many Roman aqueducts and Roman roads so lots of Feats of engineering they invented the tread Crane and I don't know if they invented the tread crane but basically they made really good use of of cranes they also Advanced uh legal systems and calendar systems so they're really good systems thinkers Roman law is actually still kind of the foundation of uh Western Law today so that's how important that was as an innovation and then of course the Greek and Roman World they invented what we now today know as philosophy and history and what I mean by invented is basically brought the brought the idea of recording all of your thoughts in books in order to preserve and transmit across time and history moving forward after the fall of the Roman Empire there was a brief Dark Ages but uh it was dark it was anything but dark for the Golden Age of Islam uh and so the Islamic scholars of this period of time between the 8th and 14th centuries uh they were really big into reading and writing they are actually the ones that preserved all the Greek and Roman writing for us today but even bigger was their impact to mathematics so algebra literally is an Arabic word uh the geometry in algebra that the Arabic Scholars contributed in the Golden Age of Islam still underpins all of Science and Engineering today so again uh it's been one long continuous thread uh basically around the Mediterranean obviously this is a very western-centric view uh the Eastern world had their uh had in in isolation completely independent from the Western World had many of the same Innovations so I am I'm very much aware that this is a Mediterranean western-centric view of engineering and Science and Technology and the history of industrial revolutions uh moving forward after the Golden Age of Islam is the Renaissance so the Renaissance was uh kicked off when we saw the invention of an of a new information technology the printing press so the printing press was the first uh thing that allowed us to mass produce intellectual content and So functionally speaking to the human mind the printing press is not much different from the internet and that it allows you to mass produce uh textual information now the internet of course adds some functional differences namely that we can transmit it around the globe instantaneously but from a cultural and intellectual standpoint they've had roughly the same effect it's just the internet is bigger and faster some other innovations that happened during the Renaissance that are still around today namely are the banking advancements and then scientific advancements um particularly those developed in the University Systems and the guild systems so basically the modern intelligencia we see today kind of got started around the 15th century late 14th and 15th century in Europe and that sets the stage for uh going straight into the first Industrial Revolution so now that you're caught up to speed how did we get from there to here so the first Industrial Revolution started in the 18th and 19th centuries and this saw the first big wave of mechanization and steam power now uh mechanization and steam power largely with textiles and food production these were static steam engines so it's basically one way to think about it is that building a steam engine that sits in one place is a lot easier than building a portable steam engine so the first Industrial Revolution was mostly about building larger machines in factories and then of course bringing people to work in those factories and so all the all the images that you have of smokestacks in Old London that's generally first Industrial Revolution uh you know and this was this was marked by a move from the more agrarian Lifestyles to uh to moving into the cities now that being said there is a lot of parallel parallels between the first and second Industrial Revolution which we'll get to right now so the Second Industrial Revolution is the 19th and early 20th century so much more modern and so the primary difference between the first Industrial Revolution and the Second Industrial Revolution is the introduction of electricity and portable steam engines so this is where you start to see Steam ships becoming really popular steam locomotives now of course steam engines have been around since the 1700s but it wasn't until they were scaled up and also that with the introduction of internal combustion engines around the early uh the turn of the century but with the Advent of electricity in modern chemistry this gave us a whole lot of new technological capabilities such as telegraphs and telephones which completely renovated the way that we were transmitting information to each other uh also with the industrial scale we saw the emergence of modern corporations so until then all you had were smaller uh you know Factory bosses right you had you had Small Time cap who are able to you know build and run a factory but usually that was the size of a business but with the Second Industrial Revolution with mass transit such as with Rail and steamships corporations started getting much larger in scale which meant that they had to have a much more sophisticated uh bookkeeping and uh you know international law and Interstate law uh had to be advanced in order to match this and during this period of time this is when we saw the rail coal and steel Barons uh that were Infamous during the early 20th century the third Industrial Revolution is the move from analog to digital so this is the primary change here where no longer are we dealing strictly with uh you know fire-based um you know uses of fuel and energy we're now in the nuclear age we have computers we have digital processing this is the origin uh the origination of the internet of email information networks and also the rise of consumer electronics uh consumer electronics were no longer the domain of business you know IBM International Business Machines uh this is where we saw the rise of uh radio TV uh computers game consoles all kinds of stuff VCRs in the home and this this explosion of information availability allowed for increasingly sophisticated Global networks such as Global Supply change uh sorry Global Supply chains as well as International conglomerate corporations until this time it just really wasn't possible to have have gigantic Mega corpse because information was just too slow so moving forward now we're at the fourth Industrial Revolution so the fourth Industrial Revolution arguably started within the last five to ten years particularly with the ramp up of AI and Robotics AI really has taken off in the last couple of years Quantum Computing is still kind of an innocent phase so we'll see how how fast Quantum Computing ramps up but the investment is there uh you know East Eastern world and Western world are both investing a lot in Quantum Computing because the dream is that Quantum Supremacy will create an exponential speed up of all kinds of things such as Material Science medicine and and possibly even solving nuclear fusion and other things blockchain and cryptocurrency Technologies these have been around for a little while and they're starting to to mature so for instance what I mean by that is that the tech giants like IBM and VMware and others are starting to provide uh Enterprise grade blockchain Solutions it's no longer just the domain of experimental open source stuff these are Enterprise grade solutions that are going to be supported by Professional Engineers and tremendous amounts of investment which means that the technology is going to become more robust and reliable and trustworthy spatial web and web 3.0 so these are technologies that are based on the saturation of Internet signals and other wireless network signals such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so basically you have uh sensors and internet everywhere so now what do you do with it you have a tremendous amount of information and and presence omnipresence of internet and then of course that extends the reach of artificial intelligence and other things we still don't really know how this is going to play out but basically information everywhere everything can be instrumented and and um and parameterized biotech and genetics some of my recent videos I've talked about how uh these these Technologies are advancing so for instance Technologies like Alpha fold and proprietary platforms are already helping with drug Discovery as and not just not just the drug Discovery but the end-to-end process of drug approvals and so when you have all these working together we're going to start to see compounding return funds and then finally nuclear fusion is another uh thing that's up and coming the investment is there already it's in the billions of dollars so it's only a matter of time before we solve this problem now of course it would be incorrect to assume or assert that nuclear fusion will be solved instantly and that it will be instantly commercially viable so on and so forth these are technologies that will be refined over time but the combination of AI Quantum Computing and all of these other Technologies will form compounding returns so what I mean by that is that we will have this kind of Snowball Effect this accumulation where they start feeding off of each other in a virtuous cycle or a positive feedback loop and that is the fourth Industrial Revolution and that is why it is so exciting and that is why I have rebranded my channel to be navigating the fourth Industrial Revolution thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of
