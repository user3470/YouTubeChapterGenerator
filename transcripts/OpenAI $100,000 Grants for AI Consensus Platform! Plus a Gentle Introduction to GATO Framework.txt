morning everybody David Shapiro here with a new video so you probably noticed a little bit of different setup I'm kind of pimping out my uh my recording setup but today we're going to talk about um the open AI Democratic inputs to Ai and the gato framework so you guys have heard me mention the gato framework quite a few times so we're gonna kind of first kind of talk about like this Democratic inputs to AI which is a grant Challenge and then I'll also introduce you to the gato framework which there is some overlap but the takeaway is that I am the gato Community are going to uh put in a um uh proposal to open ai's challenge so right off the bat the Democratic inputs to AI is uh going to be 10 100 000 grants that openai gives in order to basically democratize the way that they get feedback in order to just to decide how AI will behave so they give some examples of what they mean by a democratic process and then they also give a few examples of the kinds of questions that they're going to want to um uh address sorry where did it go here we go so one example is how far do you think the personalization of AI assistance like chat GPT uh to align with Tayson preferences should go what boundaries if any should exist in this process so these are the kinds of policy questions that they want to have a scalable system to address and they give you know quite a few examples like Wikipedia Twitter democracy next so on and so forth so there's all kinds of things uh which with those existing systems you might be what asking like okay well why what's like What's missing and so there's a few things that they talk about that they want to uh like the the criteria that they want to address so one evaluation they want to make sure that the evaluation follows metrics and so on that the methodology is good robustness obviously you want to make sure that that the resulting information that you get is robust and defensible but also resistant to trolling and other problems um inclusiveness and representativeness uh you know obviously if you only survey or pull you know a small majority of people or I guess small minority of people rather uh you're not going to have a good representation of the global willpower and Global desires of all humans and that's part of the goal here is that uh pretty much all humans are stakeholders in AI so therefore we need to make sure that we represent everyone on the planet um empowerment of minority opinions so this is uh one of the hardest problems because when you have a democratic process you often have majority rules which means that you have tyranny of the majority so how do you represent the interests of everyone while also kind of abiding by or following the collective willpower so in that case finding consensus can be very difficult effective moderation again making sure that stuff stays on topic so on and so forth scalability so again scalability is one of the chief criteria here because it needs to Encompass the entire planet finally actionability and legibility these are just kind of boilerplate requirements there's a few other footnotes um but yeah so those are the primary goals is how do you create something that can achieve this and it sounds like a very daunting task but I think that we're up to it um so with all that said um uh the gato community and actually even some of my patreons have already uh expressed interest in participating so we'll get that organized very quickly we have until uh just under a month from now to submit our proposal which I have no doubt that we'll be able to do considering we pulled the Gatto framework together in four weeks flat so we have roughly the same amount of time to do something that is less extensive basically we have to design one tool or one platform rather than an entire Global movement so I have alluded to the gato framework quite a few times so let's talk about the gato framework so you can learn about our gato framework here on gotta framework.org it is a global decentralized movement to achieve uh first and foremost Utopia which we Define utopia quite simply as a world state where everyone on the planet has high standard of living a high individual liberty and also high social Mobility so obviously the word Utopia often has a lot of baggage associated with it uh you know whether you think Star Trek or something else and Utopia means different things to different people but in terms of universal principles and also measurable like kpi or metrics we we Define utopia as uh you know high standard of living High individual liberty and high social Mobility if we get those three criteria to be Global we will consider that success now also Gatto is meant to avoid dystopia so on one hand you have Utopia versus dystopia but we also aim to avoid cataclysmic outcomes by solving problems such as a coordination problem at Daniel schmachtenberger and Liv bori talk about with Malik you've probably seen some of my other videos and the goal there is to avoid extinction by creating Global consensus around how to align AI which is a very comprehensive process we'll we'll go into it just a little bit but basically it is a decentralized layered approach to achieving Global alignment so for instance the first layer is model alignment model alignment as the low level things such as building and training and fine-tuning individual language models and other AI models multimodal models as they come so we'll address problems like fine-tuning Mesa optimization inner alignment and so on but it's important to remember that model alignment is only one small component of achieving Utopia avoiding dystopia and avoiding Extinction yes we uh we believe that there will come a time when AI becomes super intelligent and it cannot be contained and we have to get it right before that happens but even before that we could end up in dystopia right so there's kind of a gated process so model alignment even Sam Altman has said that rlhf is not the not the way to get you know solve the control problem but it's a good way to make a good chat bot so we're aligned there the next phase is autonomous systems so one thing that a lot of people are afraid of in the long run is Runaway autonomous AI basically super intelligence that has no leash that has no shackles and so one of the reasons that we advocate for building autonomous systems today is because we need to practice uh building these systems to understand the architectures and the behaviors for instance one of the things that people suspect will happen is instrumental convergence instrumental convergence is the idea that AI systems no matter what objectives you give them they will want things like to protect power to get more data that sort of stuff and so by by practicing building autonomous systems today we can go ahead and start researching and understanding one how to make autonomous systems stable even as they change and improve themselves we can also figure out what needs to go into automating their internal learning processes and stuff because super intelligence was never ever going to be a single model right it's not going to be gpt7 you know in a robot autonomous systems from a software and Hardware perspective are going to be very complex systems so we need to start working on these today and you know in point of fact people have already started working on autonomous systems and they're only going to get more powerful over time layer 3 of the gato framework is the advocacy of using decentralized Technologies such as blockchain and federations in order to uh basically first solve the problem of in the future AI will spend more time talking to each other than to us so we need to create a framework that includes things such as consensus mechanisms as well as reputation management systems because the thing is is in the future you're not going to be able to look at the code or data or design of every autonomous agent out there but instead you can look at the behavior of those agents and track it over time and so then what we can do is embed alignment algorithms into those decentralized networks and those decentralized networks can be used to gatekeep resources like data network access power and compute and that will actually change the the instrumental convergence meaning that autonomous AI agents will be incentivized to self-align if they want access to things like power data and compute and that that decentralized network will also create a layer that that allows for easy collaboration between humans and AI because again blockchain Dows and other decentralized Technologies allow for Collective consensus to be achieved before making decisions and actions and that will be the kind of the the fabric that pulls humans and AI together and so those first three layers are the technical layers those these are the coding data and cryptographic problems that goto aims to solve but it's not going to be a centralized effort this is just a road map that anyone can follow and so then the top four layers of gato are more about the social geopolitical and economic layers so for instance number four layer four is Corporate adoption we have one simple Mantra which is aligned AI is good for business fortunately it seems like some companies open AI Microsoft and IBM believe this at least in principle at least in word um you know obviously actions speak louder than words and so we will see what actions they take over time but the general principle is and many of my patreon supporters already get this and know this where you know I help them with understanding AI alignment and they say this is obviously good for business aligned AI is good for business for a number of reasons now the least of which is that it's more trustworthy and more scalable the more aligned an AI system is the more trustworthy it is and therefore the less supervision it requires which means that it is more scalable and can take on more workload faster so in this respect we hope that this pattern proves out over longer periods of time which means that those businesses that adopt aligned AI will simply do better in the long run and they will have a competitive Advantage obviously we can't count on this forever which is why we also advocate for National regulation now fortunately we have seen calls for National regulation already ranging in you know from empowering existing agencies like the FTC SEC and so on and so forth and those are of course American entities um pretty much every nation has regulatory bodies that are already in place that could be empowered to help regulate AI now that being said there's also a case to be made for advocating for an AI specific entity we're not going to take uh gato is not going to take a position one way or another but we do advocate for National regulation of some kind across the world and this National regulation is not just about um punishing or constraining we also advocate for incentivizing aligned Behavior such as through research grants and and other Financial incentives maybe even including tax breaks for companies that meet alignment standards similar to how there are carbon credits for instance as one example of incentivizing the behavior that you want to see with financial gains again we believe that aligned AI is its own Financial incentive but not everyone's going to believe that one example that I like to use is when smoking was banned from bars and restaurants when smoking was banned from bars and restaurants it actually increased patronage of bars and restaurants because a few bad actors AKA people that wanted to smoke inside that behavior was that noxious Behavior was no longer allowed and so then businesses all benefited and now it's just a foregone conclusion that you shouldn't allow smoking inside that is the kind of nature of national regulation so if we ban misaligned AI it'll bring more people to the table uh number six is international treaty sogato advocates for the creation of international agencies um openai recently published that they are advocating for an agency model perhaps on the the iaea the international atomic energy agency which is a regulator that performs inspections and other uh other uh functions around nuclear uh energy and nuclear enrichment we don't necessarily disagree with that but we think that it should be yes and sogato advocates for the creation of an entity like CERN which is primarily a research organization rather than a regulatory organization and the reason that we advocate for international um cooperation on AI research is because again we believe that eventually one day we are going to lose control of the AI in which case human regulation won't matter so what we need to do is actually focus more resources on understanding alignment and autonomous systems and how to create what we call axiomatic alignment so axiomatic alignment is one of the goal states of the gato framework wherein alignment is very difficult for AI to deviate from due to a saturation of aligned models aligned data sets and what we also call epistemic Convergence which is the idea it's very similar to to instrumental convergence but the idea of epistemic convergence is that any sufficiently intelligent entity uh no matter where they start they ought to come to some similar conclusions uh you know with obviously some variants but by intersecting with the same laws of physics the same universe the same galaxy the same Planet pretty much any sufficiently and intelligent entity ought to come to some similar conclusions and then finally the top layer of gato is global consensus wherein we use exponential Technologies like AI social media and so on in order to create Outreach Outreach into the academic institutions into primary education into industry so on and so forth and that's why I've been doing more interviews for instance so those are the layers of gotcha and taken all together the goal is to again achieve excuse me Utopia avoid dystopia and avoid collapse and each of these layers you don't have to eat the whole elephant the idea is that whatever your specialization is you can participate in gato without saying like yes I am a got to employee or whatever that's not the point um we also have the gato Traditions which is a set of 10 kind of principles or behaviors that everyone can engage in to help Advance this initiative towards Global alignment so the first tradition is start where you are use what you have do what you can basically this says that whatever you're capable of whatever your passions are and your strengths are you can use them so for instance I get a lot of messages by people saying like you know oh well I'm just a lawyer I don't know anything about AI or I'm a graphic artist or you know I just use Twitter and make memes whatever it is that you're capable of doing you can advance the initiative of AI so for instance there's a Twitter uh feed out there what is it the the AI safety memes um Twitter feed if that's all you do that's fine um if you're a lawyer you can look at uh at gato and AI alignment from a legal perspective or from a business policy perspective or whatever your perspective is you have something that you can contribute and by everyone contributing in a decentralized manner we can solve that coordination problem um that that like I said that uh Daniel smacktenberger and live Bowie point out principle number two is work towards consensus so while Global consensus is not fully possible we're not ever going to come to a unanimous decision that doesn't mean that that the idea of consensus is not valuable and very helpful in this process because what I mean by that is that when you have consensus as an as a principle as an ideal you're going to you're going to listen more you're going to listen differently and you're also going to find more novel and unique and Creative Solutions that that strive to meet everyone's needs and desires number three is broadcast your findings which is uh basically don't keep things locked up we very much advocate for open source open communication knowledge sharing and so on because knowledge sharing and broadcasting good information is part of building consensus number four is think globally act locally so think globally the problem of solving AI alignment is a global problem it is as Global as you know nuclear deterrent or or you know climate change right this is a global problem now that being said none of us have a global reach or Global influence right I'm on YouTube I do have global-ish audience but I can still only do you know something with my own hands right and so by Distributing the workload and acting locally but keeping in mind that this is a global problem we can work together number five in it to win it this is for all the cookies basically we achieve you as many people point out like we either achieve Utopia by solving all these problems or we're on an inevitable downslide towards dystopia collapse and then finally Extinction so this is what some people say a binary outcome or a bimodal outcome where it's we solve this or we don't excuse me number six is Step Up So Step Up talks about if there's something that you see that you can do you can advocate in your community in your company um in your family whatever step up speak out um it could also be uh if you if gato aligns with you download the framework start your own uh gato Community or join a community that is aligned with gato and start sharing and start doing the work but it it got to will not succeed if everyone is passive that is the key thing here number seven is think exponentially as I mentioned we very much Advocate using exponential Technologies namely social media and artificial intelligence if you can create an AI tool that helps Advance alignment whether it's by building consensus or solving problems do it if you have a communication platform podcast memes reddits whatever and use those exponential Technologies and those Network effects to get the message out to build consensus and to do uh more with less basically number eight is trust the process we are not the first decentralized Global movement and we won't be the last but the point is is that decentralized Global movements do work and in the gato framework we list about I think 8 or 11 different uh decentralized movements that we uh took inspiration from and so yes you're only going to see your little narrow part but if everyone is doing the same thing in parallel even though you don't see it you trust that it's out there and that they are doing it number nine is strike while the iron is hot there are going to be plenty of opportunities out here and this one is exactly what this policy or sorry this tradition means is open AI presented an opportunity so we're going to make use of that opportunity and so we're going to strike while the iron's hot and finally tradition number 10 divide and conquer again everyone is going to be working in parallel to solve alignment and not everyone's going to agree but that's okay right we will work towards consensus over time so that is the uh got to layers and traditions many of you have said that you want to get involved you don't need our permission to get involved however you can apply to join the main gato Community with this form we do have it automatically piped into our Discord and we automatically or not automatically but we can all uh vote on accepting members or not we also have a um first I need to tell everyone we are way behind on accepting people we also haven't fully automated the onboarding and invitation process so if you did apply on the old form we haven't gotten to you and you need to apply on the new form and number two if you don't get accepted first be patient because we're trying to get to everyone in automate as much of it as possible and number two if you're not accepted that doesn't necessarily mean that you don't have something to contribute but we we need to make sure that we don't have too many cooks in the kitchen right and so what we're going to be doing is setting up morgato communities that are more open um for everyone to join um so you know don't take it personally because there's plenty of people that that do have something to contribute but that we just don't have a role for in the main gato Community yet and then finally um if you uh if you're ready to participate we have two documents so one is the main gato framework which is a 70 page document that outlines everything that I've said here and more including lots and lots of suggestions explanations as to why how and so on you know whether you want to Advocate forgotto or participate in one layer or even we have recommendations on how to set up your own gato community and then the other document is a one-page handout which I actually take this to meetup groups now which it's if you just want to give someone a really high level snapshot of gato it's a one-page handout that um that you can use to share the idea to kind of plant those seeds and and get the conversation started um that is about it for the gato Community we also have a few more pages such as like news and updates um for anything that is uh happening with the gato Community or relevant to us we actually need to update this because I've had a few more podcasts and then we have a Community Showcase page where we'll be accumulating um use cases business cases and Other Stories of successes um relate related to AI alignment and adoption so for instance we have a few other projects a few other irons in the fire that will get updated as those get completed we've got folks participating in hackathons then of course we've got you know got to will be participating in the Democratic inputs the AI that sort of thing so if all of this resonates with you if you want to solve this problem and this is this is going to be true whether or not you believe that AGI is imminent or not this is gonna like got to as valid whether or not you believe that AI represents an existential threat because whatever else is true AI is disrupting the economy today so there are alignment questions that we need to solve today and there are coordination problems we need to solve today regardless of where AI ultimately ends up so with all that thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this and uh yeah stay tuned for more we will keep up the hard work
