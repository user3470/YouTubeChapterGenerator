hello everybody David Shapiro here uh with a update so we're going to cover two things today real quick uh fir or the big thing is I mentioned in a previous uh video we need guy a global AI agency and we're working towards that and so I created a public repository uh of news and and summaries basically where I'm collecting evidence and news that is very encouraging because it's all moving in the right direction uh we've got everything from the the future of Life Institute uh open letter to pause giant models uh news out of uh the UK the EU which yes I know that the UK left the EU I made a mistake of uh forgetting about brexit in a previous video the U.N Secretary General talking about yes he's amenable to the idea of an international AI Watchdog the United States Senate they're hearing on AI the EU AI act the U.S House of Representatives and Senate having uh now basically matched uh matched actions with words so after the after the hearing uh both people both the U.S House of Representatives and the Senate have introduced legislation or commissions or you know policies uh so we'll go over all those in much greater detail in just a moment but before we uh dive into that um I've been working on this thing I had this idea for a long time and it's basically we can use large language models like GPT because they are trained on so much text Data they're trained on data from around the globe granted it is primarily English so there is a uh there's definitely some bias uh cultural bias in there however that being said it has read so much about the world that it knows more about religion politics psychology culture history than any one person so as far as having the ability to take perspectives it's actually pretty good and so rather than you know walk you through the code I'll just show you what I've got working so far so basically what I have it do is actually first I need to make sure ah well no that's fine um so basically what I what I have it I I have it do what it does anyways um is I have it synthesize a Persona and so this Persona is a whole bunch of random uh stuff uh like variables that it can pick to basically create a synthetic person and I don't mean that in in the um in the manipulation way but it has Geographic Origins ethnicities cultures languages uh political uh dispositions uh different factors about the person such as their physical health their mental health uh other habits preferences that sort of thing and so basically what it does is to create a Persona is it'll grab one of one uh one of these variables or one option from each set of variables and then create a a profile or a dossier in order to uh like take the perspective of that person and then it will talk through on a particular issue and I picked you bi because I've been on a economics and Ubi kick lately and so uh I wanted to basically come up with a way of automatically uh understanding what the concerns that everyone is going to have uh could be but not just not just uh elucidate or articulate the problems that they will have or you know the the concerns that they'll have over a policy like Ubi but how do we actually arrive at consensus and consensus is not necessarily so a lot of people have misconception about consensus consensus doesn't mean unanimous agreement consensus means that it gets to a point that is good enough that people will kind of stop fighting it it's about compromise and so anytime that there's been any kind of uh contentious policy or legislation even including the United States Constitution nobody was happy with it because they had to come to consensus in order to get something that everyone would tolerate everyone would accept so it wasn't perfect to anyone's mind but it was something that they would all accept and so the idea is okay let's take this let's take this random profile of a person so that we can get a global representation of all perspectives regardless of how small they are because the thing is uh when you look at some of these things like atheist Islam Christianity Buddhist right some of these are uh over represented in some areas and some of them are underrepresented same thing for political leanings I even include uh Libertarians and anarchists and statists and Communists and reactionaries and populists and nationalists and fashion I don't know fascism is in here um fascism isn't in here so fascist perspectives don't get represented but nationalists do so close enough authoritarians get represented so the idea is that we can get a very well-rounded representation of all human perspectives more or less there's obviously going to be some flaws with this because it is the first uh edition first example but the idea is that you can get uh a very very diverse set of perspectives on a particular issue and then once you get those perspectives you can then work through and figure out okay what kind of policy is this person most likely to accept and so by then generating a whole bunch of potential policies you can say okay well let's look at let's look at the commonality between all of these and let's get really creative so let me just go ahead and show you how this works all right so the first thing it does is it grabs a random Persona so you see where it's like you know heavy social media user they're West Asian uh cultural background is West Asian their Geographic origin is from North Africa um so imagine a West Asian family in North Africa um they're a wealthy family they're heavy social media user so on and so forth okay so I ask what would uh this person think about Ubi and because chat GPT is so heavily trained to be a helpful assistant I can't I couldn't get chat EPT to take that perspective but what I could do is say Advocate zealously on behalf of this person and that got really good results so let's see uh as an advocate for this Persona I would say that they might have mixed feelings about Ubi on one hand they are wealthy and under and underemployed which might lead them to see ubis um uh let's see where did it go hang on okay it's saved sorry uh uh let's see unnecessary for themselves and potentially harmful to their financial status if it results in higher taxes they also might be concerned about the potential for Ubi to discourage work and productivity given their unsuccess and wealth-oriented aspirations uh on the other hand their experience with financial stress and their social concerns might make them sympathetic to the IEP idea of Ubi as a means of reducing poverty poverty and inequality however the Nationalist political affiliation might make them more inclined to support policies that prioritize the needs and interests of their own country and its citizens which could include skepticism towards Ubi if they perceive it as benefiting Outsiders as a form of globalist policy so you see it has a very nuanced way of saying okay this person has lots of different beliefs and it's pretty complex um let's see okay so given their wealth oriented aspirations nationalist political affiliation and their experience with financial stress they might resonate with a fiscal policy or Ubi implementation that is designed to stimulate economic growth and productivity while also addressing social inequality within their own country for instance they might support a Ubi program that is funded through progressive taxation where the wealthy pay a higher percentage of their income taxes this would align with their social concerns and their belief in the importance of addressing inequality however they would likely want assurances that this would not unduly burden them or negatively impact their own financial status they might also resonate with a Ubi program that includes work incentives or requirements to address their concerns about discouraging work and productivity for instance they might support a Ubi that is conditional on recipients engaging in some kind of work education or community service so this is uh this is a theme that keeps emerging because I've run this experiment a few times I don't know if that's the underlying training of chat GPT or if it's just this is the most logical Way Forward where basically either you have a requirement or an incentive or reward so basically like you get everyone gets a baseline Ubi but if you volunteer you get more Ubi right it's like a kind of adjusting your tax returns uh here in America uh okay so finally given their nationalist policy uh they want to uh Ubi that prioritizes the needs and interests of their own country citizens um so this could be something like a tax break if you buy local uh or any any number of ways so then um I ask it to say all right come up with come up with a policy that this person might like and so in this case it said the national Prosperity dividend which that sounds rather authoritarian but okay we'll go with it uh so the NPD which that's also the acronym for narcissistic personality disorder oh boy um maybe let's Workshop that before we go live with it um uh anyways so the NPD is a form of universal basic income that is designed to stimulate economic growth reduce social inequality and prioritize the needs and interest okay so you get that um so it's predicated on their engaging in some form of work education or community service part-time work vocational training higher ed so on and so forth you know actually like that particular thing because this is a recurring thing I'm not sure I'm not certain that that's actually a bad idea where like you incentivize people to continue to better themselves even if it's a small character uh carrot like you know hey if you're uh in if you're if you're going to higher education even if you know you're the college degree you're getting might not ever do anything you get an extra 500 a month you will at least be a better informed Citizen and a better Civic uh participant who knows I don't know incentivize the behavior you want to see uh oh here we go the NPD would also include a patriotic bonus oh yikes um an additional payment for those who contribute significantly to the country's economy culture or Society okay I wouldn't call it a patriotic bonus uh that's a little that's a little totalitarian but I get the I get the idea so this would include entrepreneurs artists scientists and Community leaders so actually I think Ireland um already has something like this where basically if you are a professional artist or author or whatever A Creative type you get a stipend um I don't know what they call it in Ireland but there is precedent for this being a thing so like if you're if you're a content creator or a cultural commentator or whatever you could get a little bit an additional stipend uh so all right so there there you have it um and then if we run it again so let me do a clear screen if we run it again let's say we get a young adult who's wealthy from Eastern Europe um whose culture is indigenous South American interesting um they like gaming they speak Spanish that makes sense if they're from South America um they do not care about the community and they are a very fragile person um they're an angry fragile person who's uh who is educated um they've been very experienced they had a good childhood sorry they've had a good good life experience they're presently single they're Progressive atheist um yeah this actually sounds uh oh and they're worried about their career interesting okay so let's see uh I'm not going to read the whole thing to you uh like I did the first one you get the idea um but so you see how it takes into account like the last one they were Nationalist and blah blah blah and this one is uh Progressive given their moderate intolerance they might prefer Ubi that include some form of means testing means testing keeps come up keeps coming up as well um let's see skeptical about whether everyone deserves Ubi ouch uh I there's some people on Reddit that this sounds like um and that's not to trash people on Reddit I actually learn a lot from some people on Reddit uh but yeah so uh Ubi to reduce over consumption and promote more sustainable Lifestyles yeah so this actually keeps coming up as well where uh for some people uh means testing um sustainability so basically like you might get an additional Ubi bonus if you live sustainably or you know whatever so basically like discourage over consumption that's a that's a trend that keeps coming up so okay the progressive environmental you you Ubi the Pui B the PB would be funded primarily through a progressive tax system where the wealthiest individuals and okay yeah blah blah um I haven't seen too much in terms of funding um one of them did say uh fund it through carbon taxes uh which I thought was was an interesting uh way is you partially fund it through through that to align with their environmentalist values would also oh here it is carbon tax um okay so these are some ideas that keep coming up again I think that the underlying uh model has a little bit of bias here it would be interesting to see if there is a future version of gbt that is not already pre-trained to be kind of on board with some of these ideas uh because one thing that doesn't that has come up is like if you have someone who is just adamantly opposed to it um it doesn't say like this person will never agree to this under any circumstances it works really hard to try and find something that they might agree with so anyways this is all saved out to um it's saved out into the Ubi folder as a yaml document so it just it basically just saves the conversation um as as a whole uh I think yeah it even it even includes the system message because the system message includes the uh includes the uh the the Persona and the first one it was hilarious it was a radically intolerant feminist who is a Scientologist which is just like wow um this was this was really interesting as it tried to figure out how to appease a very dogmatic uh person so anyways uh this is a work in progress um I uh I don't know where it's going exactly but the idea is that maybe you could use it for policy research maybe you could use it for um it actually came it was precip I've been thinking about it for a long time but I had some inspiration after talking to the gato Community about uh the Democratic inputs to AI because the idea of using a chat bot to extract information from a person from a real person is one thing but then I was like you know the model already has a tremendous amount of information so why don't we just bootstrap it and ask the model to kind of think through this so this is essentially a tree of thought but each branch of the tree is a different Persona and then each of those branches has three sub-branches where I ask it those three questions like uh you know what do you think this person will think about Ubi what kind of fiscal policy do you think would resonate and then finally given the Persona in their disposition can you creatively conjure up a policy that has a high chance of reaching consensus with this person so it's you know basically you can create an arbitrary number of branches and then as you as those branches span out and you get all the leaves you gather the leaves together and see what fits okay anyways so you're up to date on that project so let's dive back into the Gaia initiative the global AI agencies so I've been watching the news and I realized that the number of things that are piling up that make me feel good and I know that there's a lot of people out there that are skeptical of uh of anything to do with government or corporations um and for those people I empathize with you uh growing up I was more like that where I was super skeptical of all uh trappings of power and certainly my friends were very like disestablishmentarianism and anarcho libertarian whatever um but none of them ever did anything with it uh so this is the world we live in we live in a world with corporations and governments and stuff and yes all power needs to be scrutinized healthy skepticism is uh absolutely fine that is part of the democratic process that being said if you're dogmatically against all forms of power well I mean wish in one hand and you know you know what to do with the other one see which one fills up first so anyway ways I have been keeping track of all this stuff because I see the currents and the trends and it is actually very very encouraging to me so I've got it all in chronological order so first was the future of Life Institute published there um their open letter you know signed by everyone including Elon Musk and yada yada yada what I didn't realize was that it actually came with a policy paper and so this policy paper it's only 14 pages and it has uh seven policy recommendations uh so this this came out in uh let's see uh April 12th um I think I might have that wrong the the pause the the big pause um oh so the paper was published March 22nd the uh the policy recommendations came out a few few days later a couple weeks later so what I did was I took all that and then I made a very brief summary of the whole thing right here so you can click on the link and see it but you know it's a few basic things mandate robust third party auditing regulate organizations access to computational power uh established capable AI agencies at the national level establish liability for AI caused harm uh introduce measures to prevent and track AI model leaks expand AI technical Safety Research and develop standards for identifying and managing AI generated content okay sure whatever it's all pretty boilerplate in the grand scheme of things but so that came out March April uh March 29th the UK did this uh this uh Joby which I haven't had a chance to summarize yet but basically the idea is uh and a pro Innovation AI regulatory framework Etc et cetera again you see how long this thing is that's why it takes a little takes a little bit of doing to summarize with uh with a GPT API calls so anyways they call for a regulatory sandbox um which so does the EA the eua good grief e-u-a-i act also calls for regulatory sandboxes um so if you if you don't know a regulatory sandbox is basically you create a safe space where you can experiment with AI um you know that is uh a little bit more permissive so and this is this is very often the case so for instance um one of the most familiar ones is if you're doing medical research for instance you're allowed to use uh substances that are otherwise illegal uh you just have to go through uh approval processes that's not quite the same but the idea is that like people have been able to experiment with THC and LSD and psilocybin even though it's still a schedule two drug or whatever in the United States you just have to you have to be approved to do so likewise if you are an approved entity uh the idea of a regulatory sandbox is that you can still do whatever science you need to do as long as you do so safely but also one thing about these Pro Innovation things is and this is a common theme that I actually noticed which is why I was inspired to do this so the UK and the United States have all uh focused on protecting Innovation and accelerating innovation in fact um so then uh in early May the U.N Secretary General Antonio guterres said that he's amenable to the idea of the iaea for AI which also open AI I forgot to add that but open AI basically published a Blog calling for the same thing uh then a few days later uh the United States uh Senate hearing on AI this was the one with Sam Altman um and Christina Montgomery Montgomery and and Gary Marcus this was almost a three-hour talk and I took the transcript of that and I summarized it here so the high level summary um you know basically just says here's the key points that they discussed and then I break each one of those down further um so it takes you you know 20 minutes to read this instead of three hours um it's pretty straightforward uh you know I there was a lot of back and forth a lot of questions I watched pretty much the entire hearing um but clearly uh the United States government was listening um and I wonder if this whole thing was just an orchestrated series of events or or you know it or not um but anyways a month later the EU AI Act was uh proposed I don't think it's been adopted or ratified or anything someone explained in the comments that um there's still quite a process to go through they've got to get feedback but then more recently in just the last couple days uh the the uh United States House of Representatives uh by uh representative Ted loot excuse me Ted Lew and a few others um introduced a bipartisan uh commission basically it's an AI commission I summarized it here it's pretty uh or no sorry I didn't summarize it here I um I copied the text here because their PDF was garbage um seriously like this is the United States you can pay someone who knows how to make a PDF good Lord so anyways It's relatively straightforward mostly this is just saying like let's appoint a panel to make to come up with policy recommendations um it's not really they're not going to do anything the whole basically it's going to produce three reports um and so this is going to recommend what the United States Congress does uh for AI okay great you know Congressional commission um they're they're interested in getting more information which means that they're going to solicit experts so one thing that I thought was most interesting was that was the the panel um is that they that they want to have members of the commission shall have a demonstrated background in at least one of the following computer science or AI specifically Civil Society including constitutional rights civil liberties ethics and the creative Community industry and Workforce and then government including National Security so when you get these kinds of people in a room together it's not just engineers and not just data scientists this is going to be people that are in political science uh civil rights civil liberties industry insiders and then finally National Security Experts so this is going to be a pretty comprehensive set of recommendations and I'm actually pretty happy um to see that that Ted Lou is leading that and Ted Lou is um where's he is he the Los Angeles County um so it's not surprising that you know California bro is going to be figuring that out um okay and then finally most recently was just a couple days ago uh Chuck Senator Chuck Schumer announced the safe framework uh at the csis which is really interesting um and I don't know if this has been ratified yet or anything I haven't been able to find the actual text of the uh of the of the idea but there is a one-pager out there somewhere um that that summarizes it very succinctly but I took I took the transcript from this and I summarized the the talk here so basically uh the the it comes down to four uh major components uh security which basically talks about uh National Security uh above all else but also uh corporate security and uh privacy of citizens accountability which talks about how do you uh how do you it's it's actually pretty similar to the EU thing where oh I forgot to mention this for the EU AI act the primary thing that the EU AIX does is it bans outright social Credit Systems and surveillance um like high uh basically Big Brother bans Big Brother stuff and so this is what the security and accountability does uh an interesting part of this was the foundations aspect of the framework so basically uh one of the key things of Chuck Schumer's uh framework is to protect the foundations of democracy so I was talking with my wife about this and she suspects that this was a direct reaction to the January 6th uh attempted Insurrection at the U.S Capitol um you know when people are breaking into uh and and keep in mind that many members of Congress were directly in danger and so we suspect we being my wife and I we suspect that this is actually uh basically the Congress uh you know House of Representatives and Senators um you know they didn't take social media seriously and then you know Facebook happened with Cambridge analytica I don't think it's controversial to say that that Facebook uh and other social media companies directly contributed to the widespread abuses of misinformation um but also just coordination of violence it's that simple um and so they they learned their lesson by not taking social media seriously and now they're taking artificial intelligence very seriously so on a cynical note this is basically the establishment wanting to protect the establishment and the status quo that is a pretty cynical take that doesn't mean that it's the only thing uh because I actually listened to all of Chuck Schumer's talk and he had a very clear like Words matter um he had a very clear-eyed understanding of what's coming he even talked about the the possibility of of jobs dislocation he likened it to uh globalization and offshoring because he said like yes globalization and offshoring did actually help the economy because it you know allowed us to lower the prices of goods and services but at the same time millions of Americans lost their job and so the implication there was that the United States government did not do a good enough job to protect Americans um while we were rabidly offshoring in the the 90s and and 2000s um and then finally explainability uh some people commented that Chuck Schumer doesn't really seem to understand how AI Works uh because you can't just it's not it's not a database that you can like say oh this is where it got the data from that being said I think that these commissions will figure out um you know that that you while you can't look at the uh uh the model and then for what was in it you can look at the training data so what I suspect is that there's going to be a very soon open source standards on training data so basically in order to be a licensed and approved and publicly available model the underpinning training data will have to be publicly available or at least inspected um he did he did talk about Innovation first as well so this is a common theme that's emerging at least in Britain and America the EU is less concerned about Innovation they're more concerned about uh fundamental civil rights and foundational human rights uh which is good like I would I would actually like that but as an individual Nation they are highly highly focused on focusing on Innovation first and then safety rights accountability and stuff so it's basically here's the road map of how to innovate safely and fast and quickly uh and the idea is there are geopolitical competitions happening uh Vladimir Putin said uh what I think it was 2021 the nation that solves artificial intelligence will own you know the next Century um and it's probably going to be a lot longer than that uh Russia unfortunately for them does not have the economy or the uh they have brain drain so they're not going to be a participant in artificial intelligence uh it's basically going to come down to America versus China versus the EU uh but the EU is more ideologically aligned with America uh and vice versa so it'll basically come down to East versus West um which is basically you know the same idea of World War II and the Cold War which was Western ideology versus Eastern ideology so this is what the geopolitical conflict is shaping up to be for the next Century yay repeat of the 20th century let's hope that it's not as bloody uh and I say that flippantly but I am dead serious because um the stakes are very very high here which is why I call this the Gaia initiative because Gaia is Greek for Earth or Mother Earth and also Gaia was the goddess of monsters too so on the topic of Malik and shogoth and all those other things I think that Gaia is a really appropriate name so anyways this is out here it's just under um github.com Dave shop guy initiative um I will update this as interesting news comes out I might forget about it for a while I tend to do that but it's up there and I find all this news very encouraging so thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of it cheers
