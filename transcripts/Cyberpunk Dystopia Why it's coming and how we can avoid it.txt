morning everybody David Shapiro here with a video so today's video is about the uh cyberpunk dystopian future that we are heading towards and then also how to avoid it so jump right into the show let's talk about cyberpunk let's characterize this genre so the first thing that you need to know about cyberpunk is that the uh the central theme the central Motif that was enshrined I think back in the late 80s uh was high-tech low life so everything about cyberpunk uh orbits around this concept uh high-tech advancements but everyone is living kind of a low life you know deteriorated social structures socioeconomic divides inequality uh poverty that sort of thing so you see this repeated in everything from Blade Runner to cyberpunk and a whole slew of movies uh and also if it seems like I'm going kind of quick in this video it's because this is there's a lot of slides to cover and we will go over these things several times another feature of cyberpunk is that everything is for sale uh whether you want uh human life experiences remote emotions uh you know sex everything is is absolutely for sale this is explored uh in particular in Altered carbon where the ultra Elite will do everything from buying and cloning their own bodies to uh you know purchasing experiences where they literally like murder people for fun uh that sort of thing so everything is for sale in a cyberpunk universe another thing is that nothing is sacred in a cyberpunk universe Traditional Values have been replaced with corporate values uh everything has been commoditized and trivialized so whatever you want to sell uh it's for sale because once again nothing is sacred this is has to do with disillusionment and skepticism towards traditional power structures again we see this quite extensively in Blade Runner particularly Blade Runner 2049 and one of the kind of most dystopian things was that the central theme or I guess one of the one of the goals of the villain in 2049 was to get the the the replicants to be able to reproduce sexually so therefore you could have unlimited slaves which is of course an exaggeration of kind of the worker drone mentality that people have today but again the idea that nothing is sacred including human reproduction childbirth motherhood that sort of thing is exemplified here in that Paradigm of nothing is sacred State of Decay so one of the common most common visual elements is that everything seems rusted or disintegrating and the reason for this is because the government is often depicted as corrupt and effective or just absent and so that means infrastructure is not being maintained uh there is a loss of faith in the government's ability to do anything and so this is shown repeatedly in Games movies and books um basically you know you see Urban Decay dirty streets uh where everything is just kind of haphazardly stacked on top of each other so that visual chaos is also part of the part of the motif and the reason is because it indicates that there's no Central planning that it's kind of a free-for-all which is another example of the abdication of government responsibility all unadulterated ID so in this case I mean ID in the Freudian sense of superego ego and ID and so if you're not familiar with the concept of ID it is the Primal instincts and base desires that all humans have for pleasure aggression greed uh those sorts of things gluttony basically the seven deadly sins uh um and so but rather than contain those with social more as a sense of decorum um they're celebrated and exploited and so this for instance is one reason that we see like heckling as a thing that's happening more and more in uh American politics is because it's basically uh enabling and celebrating trolling rather than any sense of decency or decorum um and so the the constraints of society superego the moral compass or the the dignity that we want to hold ourselves to is no longer in place and so instead we focus on immediate gratification immediate gratification consequences be damned this has to do with that ongoing commodification of desires so basically the algorithm manipulates what you want to see which is why we have things today like thirst traps um so this is actually something that's actually happening um and again it was predicted and described uh in plenty works of fiction throughout the 80s 90s and 2000s uh utter abandonment and so this is something that is implied but people rarely talk about but basically social structures break down uh community supports government supports have been systematically either trashed or abandoned uh which basically means that people need to adopt a uh disposition of rugged individualism or tight-knit group survival because nobody's going to look out for you and this again has to do with the abdication of government responsibility uh hyper competition prevails which rewards uh Cutthroat tactics and power seeking Behavior that's another central theme in pretty much all cyberpunk genre media and so basically power seeking is not just accepted but it is rewarded and exploited and this is also part of the fabric of society today which we'll go over in just a moment uh yeah and so then the lack of social safety nets means that uh basically you know you combine lawlessness from the absenteeism of the government with this rewarding of cutthroat mentalities and that's why you have this really kind of hard-boiled sink or swim uh Motif in all cyberpunk media authoritarian brutality so when you uh basically get rid of you know uh law enforcement as a public service then it becomes a tool of the powerful Elite or privatized corporations or both and so then it becomes a blunt instrument of Oppression and control rather than a social service uh this is portrayed with uh the um with the police forces of the cyberpunk world having a lack of accountability for instance often acting with impunity and acting a little bit gross and this resonates with with society today because often police are given the benefit of the doubt and uh and are not really necessarily held to consequences uh this is a reflection of growing inequality and the consolidation of power amongst the uh wealthy Elite we see this in cyberpunk 2077 with militech which is a fully privatized uh police force in military force we also see this in Altered carbon with the praetorians which are just this like super high-tech highly trained uh paramilitary force that is used to crack down on pretty much like any descent and finally corporate feudalism so corporate feudalism is basically the consolidation of Mega corporations which gives them control of everything all aspects of society all goods and services including politics and culture which they use uh you know mass media campaigns PR campaigns and controlling the narrative to basically shape the entirety of your experience uh in these cases in cyberpunk uh worlds they basically act as Sovereign entities uh replacing governments again one of the one of the recurring themes is the abdication or absence of government and so this is where corporate loyalty replaces National Allegiance and of course we see this reflected in society today where we have uh media that kind of pokes fun at the idea that like your company is your family which is complete and utter BS uh you know and this is also a reflection of the unchecked power and growth of Corporations where profit motives uh overrule literally everything else and corporations get to dictate reality through controlling media through controlling advertising and uh public perception through narratives so again we see this a lot in many many uh forms of media okay so a lot of this seems really real doesn't it there's a reason for that so let's get into why the primary reason that everything in cyberpunk seems a little too real is neoliberalism and so I've mentioned neoliberalism a few times in past videos and so we're gonna go over it really quickly with a little bit new context so we have these two to thank in the western world for codifying and enshrining neoliberalism in the Western World so Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were both elected around the same time and both of them had fully drank the Kool-Aid of neoliberalism okay so what is the Kool-Aid of neoliberalism there are a bunch of principles of neoliberalism and so you might hear this word like oh liberalism therefore it's communism or socialism no it's literally the exact opposite so neoliberalism is a really disgusting euphemism for what we have today now that being said uh GDP is going up so like it has worked in that respect but when we connect cyberpunk to neoliberalism you'll see why it's really awful so first marketization if something is outside the market bring it into the market commoditize all goods and services again everything is for sale privatization transfer public goods and services to private ownership in the name of efficiency again pretty gross you take that out to The Logical conclusion and that's why we see stuff like militech and the trauma team in cyberpunk 2077 where if you don't have money uh you're out you're excluded from the system uh deregulation again abdication of government responsibility the government says you know we're actually going to take our hands off the wheel and just trust the market to work it out on its own um shrinking the government so uh reducing government spending reducing government intervention and basically again continuing to take your hands off the wheel free trade remove trade barriers to Foster uh movement of more goods and services this is not necessarily intrinsically evil but it does support offshoring which means that like you know that's why we have the Rust Belt or part of the reason that we have the Rust Belt here in America but also one of the one of the dark sides of free trade is that free trade of what of human flesh of you know trafficking you know Miners and and sex trafficking and all kinds of stuff so it's like you can easily just kind of adapt uh that say like a free trade at all costs to things that are maybe shouldn't be traded fiscal charity so again reduce government spending to encourage privatization and lowering taxes for the rich basically trickle down economics flexible labor markets so flexible labor markets is a very euphemistic way for undermining label labor protections um and it is in the name of enhancing flexibility for employers basically employment at will means that you can be fired at any time for any reason um and then also you undermine uh labor unions in order to fully remove bargaining power for workers so this is why over the last 40 years corporations have been able to basically take this this mentality particularly in America where they can treat you however they wish they only treat you as good as they are required to by law in order to be competitive in the labor market uh economic efficiency so basically use Efficient Market Theory to aim for economic efficiency Above All Else uh entrepreneurship uh you know that's pretty pretty uh pretty standard but the idea one thing is that uh strong property rights is one of the reasons uh one of the things embedded in neoliberalism which is why it's because the theory was uh you have very strong property rights you encourage entrepreneurship that includes intellectual property which means that people are incentivized to build companies and so basically the idea was let's do neoliberalism and so then some people can become billionaires or trillionaires and they will be incentivized because the underpinning theory of human nature is that people are just intrinsically greedy and that there will never be enough that the more you can get the more you want and so this was codified and enshrined in neoliberalism which is why we have such strong property laws and a lot of people have drank the Kool-Aid of strong property laws uh most notably the people who who tend to be most uh excluded from this which is the anarcho-capitalists and uh Die Hard Libertarians um it's very interesting the people who have the least property are often the most uh fixated on property law anyways globalization International Commerce and offshoring trade again uh goes back to free trade and then finally inflation control so rather than using monetary policy uh to for social means such as maintaining in uh social uh standard of living and employment it is used monetary policy to control inflation the idea was that using monetary policy to control inflation would uh create a more stable environment in which people could flourish but by de-prioritizing social and social goals uh it kind of you know you stop measuring it and so basically neoliberalism in a nutshell is maximize economic growth through free market principles and to heck with everything else okay so let's provide some historical context as to how and why neoliberalism happened what was the philosophical and cultural Zeitgeist that led to this so first nihilism uh our our good friend uh nihilism basically said nothing has any meaning and another way of saying that is that nothing is sacred uh so you know nothing is sacred but the will to power is all that matters power seeking behavior and power-seeking mentalities acquiring more power for its own sake and no other purpose that's what nihilism maybe it's not what people said because I can already hear some people in the audience saying well actually and so here's the thing is there's what something says in theory and how it is actually interpreted and used and so this is very common where things are kind of simplified once they get out into the world and so yes I know that some crusty old philosopher said that this is what it means but in reality the way that nihilism has been applied is that nothing is sacred and power-seeking behavior is good modernism came in the mid 20th century so about 50 to 60 years later also said nothing is sacred and that includes virtues values or truth and so this uh post-modernism says let's reject all narratives just because we can't come to consensus on a few things so we're just going to categor categorically reject everything and throw it at throw the baby out with the bath water well that created a power vacuum of intellectual moral philosophical values and virtues and truth and guess who filled that vacuum corporations and so corporations said well okay so if if the Intelligentsia is going to bicker and kind of implode because of post-modernism we are more than happy to fill the void with narratives advertising and PR campaigns and so the intellectuals of the mid 20th centuries really shot all of ourselves in the foot and this set the stage for neoliberalism neoliberalism uh basically was a economic extension of nihilism and post-modernism which said well nothing is sacred we don't actually care about human values and human dignity because well nobody can agree on it and so then that really set the stage of saying okay well maybe we just maximized for a market efficiency above all else because you guys already told us that morals and values and philosophy don't really matter anymore and again I know that that's not what post-modernism actually said but that is the Fallout that is looking at post-modernism from an economic lens and from a business lens it's like well we're allowed to Define virtues and values now so we're going to redefine uh your relationship to work we're going to redefine your relationship to consumerism and that is the uh Zeitgeist flowing directly from nihilism to post-modernism to neoliberalism and that is why we have cyberpunk and that is why why we have had flat wages for the last 40 plus years neoliberalism has failed the people now GDP has continued going up great but neoliberalism has failed the people and this is why we have cyberpunk as a genre so let me just drive this home cyberpunk equals neoliberalism everything that you see in the cyberpunk universe is and is a commentary and exaggeration of directly taken from neoliberal policies it is not an accident that cyberpunk as a genre was created in the early 80s immediately after the global rise of neoliberalism cyberpunk is that cautionary representation of the inevitable conclusion of neoliberal policies unbridled corporatism for instance everything is for sale uh marketize and commoditize everything privatize shrink government abdication of government uh you're on your own so now obviously uh cyberpunk is fiction it is a slight exaggeration but uh that being said it's less and less an exaggeration of what we're actually seeing out there in the world and so this is why these stories resonate so much right now it is time for something new so what do we replace it with we need an entirely new framework an entirely new doctrine and an entirely new set of assumptions but what do we what do we replace it with this is where I uh beat on the drum of post-labor Economics so post labor economics is uh specifically an economic theory and policy instead of doctrines and principles meant to directly replace neoliberalism so the primary mission of post-labor economics if neoliberalism was to maximize market efficiency and market growth or maximize GDP sorry maximize economic growth through free market principles the primary mission of post-labor Economics is to decouple human welfare from economics to fully separate our well-being from the economic engines of humanity we want to disentangle monetary and fiscal policy from human dignity because right now they're still married where the idea was that your personal prosperity and dignity was directly tied to the economy which was directly tied to your job but with post-labor economics that is not going to be the case anymore and we're rapidly heading in that direction and this is a set of principles and policies a new paradigm that we will need in order to achieve this and it will be necessary sooner rather than later so what are the principles of post-labor economics we went over the principles of neoliberalism so let's set an entirely new or look create an entirely new set of economic principles principle number one accelerate automation let's replace human labor as quickly as possible get humans out of the workforce number two disentangle process or progress sorry remove human bottlenecks from scientific medical and economic progress we want to use machines to go as quickly as possible number three Universal welfare guarantee basic goods and services enshrine human dignity as part of our economic Doctrine number four redistribute wealth with getting humans out of the way with turning the economy up to 11 and accelerating economic stuff will also need to create new economic cycles and systems in order to capture some of that wealth and redistribute it to everyone democratized technology such as using open source and public intellectual property as well as Public Funding number six strengthen democracy enhance institutions to fight corporate power this is where we need to literally just reverse course from neoliberalism where neoliberalism said you know take your hands off the wheel take your hands off the reins we need to reverse course because that really hasn't worked out for us we need to number seven drive down prices use AI to collapse prices as much as possible number eight adopt uh holistic metrics when we decouple the economy from human dignity GDP is going to have even less of an impact on our individual lives you and me localization number nine onshore vital resources goods and services and support and promote circular economies and number 10 include the natural world price in the environment and add things like extraction tax so now let's go into these principles in a little bit more depth so for under accelerate automation number one obviously just Embrace Innovation this is a big part of what I do professionally and with my YouTube channel which is let's teach businesses how to use AI to automate as much as possible now this frees up human potential the second part of this to more creative and meaningful and productive Pursuits which is okay how do we go further faster or how do we pay attention to our own lives and develop more sense of well-being and meaning this will boost the economy by accelerating growth and reducing labor costs yada yada yada you get the point encourage flexibility so this by deploying Ai and building more and more AI tools this will have broad spectrum effects on the economy disentangle progress so part two is removing those bottlenecks if we can re if we can reduce or remove our Reliance on human labor then that means the only the next limiting factor is going to be how how fast and how smart and how much AI you have uh then that will allow us to focus on what we're better at whether it's creativity or higher level tasks at least until those tasks get replaced by AI unlocking potential and fostering inclusivity sure you know boilerplate ideas but the idea is disentangling uh progress from Human constraints Universal welfare this is basically guaranteeing uh some level of dignity where we say okay we did an experiment where we said that human dignity was no longer the responsibility of government and we don't like that it actually really made us angry and and it was very dystopian and so now we're going to say that ensuring dignity is actually once again absolutely the responsible responsibility of the government and so this is by promoting equality building security and safety nets and fostering uh social cohesion through those shared benefits um of you know hey here's the new deal where you know your job goes away but you will be taken care of redistribution of wealth so this is basically going to be necessary for this final final reason which is just to offset deflation um this is one thing that a lot of you point out on my videos which is that if we all lose our jobs then we don't have any money and we can't patronize the companies that want our money anyways so basically we're going to need to have new uh economic cycles and new patterns of circulation of wealth in order to uh basically keep the economy running so redistribution of wealth not on some lofty principle but just out of sheer dumb necessity some form of redistribution of wealth will be absolutely necessary sooner rather than later uh democratizing technology so uh you know push open source this is a big reason that I have uh enshrined as much of my work as I can in the public domain whether through the MIT license or the creative common xero license and so the reason that I do this is because the more more space I take up and guarantee that something is in the public domain the less that other people can can uh use friction to slow it down and so part this is this is one thing that I still agree with with neoliberalism and I didn't write this down but that is to reduce friction so democratizing technology is about reducing friction so that anyone can use it corporations private citizens governments around the world because that is one way to uh make sure that we all have equal access to the benefits of it if everyone has access to it then it's not special anymore and that's okay though because everyone has access to air but you need it so just because everyone has access to it and it's not special anymore doesn't mean that you don't need it uh yeah so democratized technology number uh or I don't know which number one I think it's number six strengthen democracy so strengthening democracy means uh strengthening institutions the resilience of government um transparency for accountability this is really critical and this is something that many Western countries do okay at um they could do better um increasing citizen involvement such as by enshrining uh uh like national holidays for voting um that's a that's a that's one way uh protecting uh rights whether it's civil rights social rights Collective rights that sort of thing expanding the government deliberately expanding the government to have a more active in uh role in the economy and everything else because again one of the principles of neoliberalism is to deliberately have government pull back well now the government has receded too much and it's time to come back into full focus a little bit more uh and that is a again kind of reversing course from neoliberalism I'm not saying that we need to have gigantic government and huge government overreach but what I'm saying is that the government has receded too much and now we need the government to come back another thing is using AI using these new technologies to maximize the efficiency of government so that the government can do more with less and that it can do it better faster safer cheaper drive down prices so this is one of the number one things that's going to support a post-scarcity environment or a hyperabundance economy which is use artificial intelligence and all the new technologies to reduce costs across the board uh and now one thing that I anticipate that's going to happen with this though is that we might drive down the price of some goods and services so much that they're not going to be sustainable uh as private Industries and so in those cases I think what we'll probably need to do is subsidize those so for instance one thing that I predict is that within about 10 to 20 years hospitals are going to start to just completely collapse but we're still going to need them and so then I suspect that hospitals will either become uh Municipal services or highly subsidized Services we'll see how that plays out and it'll probably vary a lot from region to region there'll probably be some places where hospitals are just run by the county for instance in more rural places but I can imagine in more urban places hospitals will probably be more like subsidized private companies we'll see how that plays out uh holistic metrics so again as I mentioned a moment ago GDP is not going to be a good metric for uh personal well-being anymore because literally the point of post-labor Economics is to divorce human well-being from the economy so GDP will still be there to measure the economy and of course the economists are still going to be like okay cool you know growth is good I don't you know there's some debate about that because GDP growth is slowing down so we might enter into a plateau or a degrowth phase just by virtue of the fact that GDP growth is slowing down and there doesn't seem to be anything we can do about it we'll see if AI affects that but what we do need to do is is focus on metrics of well-being such as mental physical social health for the people because the government exists of the people for the People by the people and it is not serving the people right now so we need more holistic metrics to to measure the government we need we the people need to have a government report card to determine whether or not the government is serving us and our needs and our wants and so we need to take back power and the way that you take back power is that you have better metrics and new metrics so focusing on sustainability and balance as an as an example um of those kinds of things localizing economies so bringing resources goods and services back onshore closer to the point of consumption this just makes sense and we're we're facing deglobalization right now anyways and so let's just let's just enshrine this and say yes it's actually better if you depend on food water and other goods and services that are let's say within a hundred mile radius of you because then you're not dependent upon whatever's going on on the other side of the world um this there's a lot of good reasons for this not the least of which is National Security and economic stability this includes circular economies which is uh basically like uh the the next generation of recycling where you have inputs and outputs that all kind of circulate in a local region which is much more efficient and so this is focusing on resiliency and reducing Global interdependence because one of the reasons that we uh promoted Global interdependence was after World War II the prevailing theory was that Global interdependence would reduce War because if you're economically dependent upon your neighbor you're less likely to declare war on them but as we're heading towards a multi-polar world future at least in the near term uh where it's basically entire continents have Consolidated I don't think that Global interdependence Works economic interdependence across you know North America and across Europe and across Asia Asia as those geographically constrained regions I think that makes sense I don't think it yet makes sense to have one global economy right now uh and then including the natural world we need to price in the environment and we already see people experimenting with this with things like carbon tax because the idea is okay well you're polluting so we're going to tax that because you know we need to offset and one you want to you want to disincentivize pollution but you also need to offset uh the harm that's being done in hypothetically use those carbon taxes to help the environment but I think that what we need to do is rather than you know say oh well we need to remove them the the environment from the market we just need to price it in uh we need to have more experiments such as carbon taxes maybe more extraction taxes um value-added taxes are something that's really popular in other parts of the world but the idea is that uh we essentially need a sustainability tax we need to make sure that everything that we do is priced for sustainability and that means um moving away from an extraction based model and finally we need a new social contract so we need to redefine the role of business and government which is kind of what I'm talking about here which is okay corporations are way too big way too powerful we need to dial that back uh on the other hand the government has been dialed back too much so now we need to dial it back up this also is pivoting from a purely growth-centric model to a human-centric model focused on human needs and well-being and then it's also about alignment because we all want some of the same things we all want to have a more prosperous economic future we just all want to make sure that we're all participating and so one of the central uh kind of motifs of neoliberalism was okay well uh just make the pie bigger right everyone wants a piece of pie so you make the pie bigger well that mentality doesn't necessarily work especially if you've got one person controlling the pie cutter so you need you need a more you need a a more fair way of Distributing a larger pie and this includes by aligning values and shared goals but Above All Else long-term thinking short-term thinking is highly incentivized right now across uh at every level of society I have a friend who's a civil engineer and she was telling us about how like a lot of uh civil projects they're they're literally thinking in two-year Cycles because they're like okay well I'm gonna spend money here um so that I can get reelected and so this is why a lot of American cities are very haphazard is because zoning laws and you know property sales and all that kind of thing uh are done with very very short-term thinking and short-term thinking is really dumb because we're capable of much longer term thinking but the reason that long-term thinking and decisions that are good for the long term aren't made is because we have short-term incentives okay so really important question when do we adopt post-labor economics so there's four primary signals that I've identified that we can use to determine when it is time to move to post-labor economics it's not yet but it will be soon so number one Rising employment if you see employment creeping up and not going back down it's time to start talking about post-labor economics declining labor participation rate so we kind of already see this uh I think America peaked at about 66 percent a few years ago and now it's hovering around 63 percent so I suspect that total labor participation rate is going to continue to decline and so as that drifts down that's going to be a second signal to pay attention to for post-labor economics number three is falling prices so as we deploy more AI as some of these other principles that I've talked about which is you know encourage competition use AI to collapse prices of goods and services we should see falling prices uh ideally start to happen and so as prices go down then it becomes more economically feasible to create more entitlements uh such as you know guaranteeing access to basic goods and services and finally increasing deflationary pressures such as job loss people having less money and the economy becoming moral upsided where people have less purchasing power that's going to lead to deflation and like I said in in a few slides ago there's going to be a lot of things that need to be done such as redistribution of wealth just by sheer virtue of the economy is going to stall out if we don't do that and so those these are the kind of the four primary economic trends that I've identified to pay attention to for when it is time to implement post-labor economics thank you for watching I hope you got a lot out of this stay tuned for more and yeah cheers
