good morning everybody David Shapiro here today's video is uh going to be on both of my channels and the reason is because uh paying attention to the conversation uh really the impact of artificial intelligence and how it's going to change the world is people are coming around to understand that something big is happening and as I've pointed out in other videos uh and online there has never been a case of a new technology not transforming human society and what I mean by that is from the Advent of writing the printing press radio television and Internet every time we invent a new information technology it fundamentally changes The Human Condition and I don't mean like you know we're no longer human but it changes the way that we interact with the world and it changes the way that we interact with each other and artificial intelligence is no different whether or not AI ever becomes sentient or autonomous or AGI or super intelligence that's not the point artificial intelligence is already changing the landscape there have been Mass layoffs due to AI uh there are cases of uh basically students just entirely relying on artificial intelligence to do their homework so it's already changing the philosophical and information landscape of humanity and one question that keeps coming up is you know well what happens if we all lose our jobs you know Dave you talk about post-labor economics but you know there are people that would you know say they say they'd rather die than you know lose the Dignity of Labor and we are also in the midst of what I call a nihilistic crisis which we'll unpack later but I just wanted to provide some context some flavor as to why this video is coming out now and uh and and where we're going and basically the reason is that humanity is about to change drastically and this philosophy I believe is a necessary contribution to the conversation I'm not going to say that this is the next Universal philosophy it's just an idea to put out there and I think that it'll be very helpful as Humanity navigates these coming changes so post nihilism the central Axiom is meaning is not necessary so let's Dive In here's a basically a table of contents for the rest of the video uh first we're going to talk we're going to tackle the history of Western philosophy it's going to be a very high level overview I'm not going to bore you to death with all the details then we'll move on and talk about more contemporary movements such as the rise of secularism and the rise of nihilism we'll talk about the death of meaning which kind of leads us to where we are now uh we'll talk about post-modernism and absolute truth and this is an example of how technology has changed our interaction with philosophy and each other because basically the rise of mass media challenged uh any notion of what does what does truth even mean and of course now we are in a post-truth era and then number five we're going to talk about a few contemporary thinkers some of them uh are still alive some of them aren't but basically we'll talk I'll address where other people are taking the conversation and by virtue of that contrast I'll show you how I'm taking it in a different direction uh then I'll unpack the meaning crisis or what I call the nihilistic crisis uh which I have articulated I I believe I've articulated it more clearly than other people have number seven uh we'll talk about moving beyond nihilism how do you get out of the Quagmire of nihilism number eight I'll Define post nihilism a little bit more clearly number nine I'll give you the background uh how I came up with post nihilism uh number 10 I'll share some of the influences some of the global influences that I had uh that kind of informed post nihilism number 11 we'll talk about letting go of the demand for meaning because this is the primary transition from uh whatever worldview you have right now to a post-nihilistic worldview number 12 will unpack some of the principles of postnilism and this is not an exhaustive list but it's one thing just to keep in mind that like okay here are some Downstream derivative effects of post-nihilism and then finally 13 we will uh we'll talk about some of the criticisms uh some of the things uh that you might just say well what about this okay so let's Dive In as promised here is a very high level overview of the history of Western philosophy so it starts uh the Western tradition starts in ancient Greece specifically Athens with Socrates Plato and Aristotle uh most of you have at least heard a few things from these guys Socratic method um Plato's dialogues and and the Republic that sort of thing um Aristotle said something along the lines of uh it is the mark of an educated mind to entertain an idea without accepting it otherwise known as analytic third space moving forward the Romans adopted a tremendous amount of influence from the Greeks but they took it a different direction so particularly Marcus Aurelius really set the tone for stoicism which stoicism is not about suppressing emotions it's about recognizing emotions and then just choosing to be rational anyways a lot of people misinterpret stoicism to be ignore emotions suppress emotions and that's what I call actually toxic stoicism so anyways don't want to get lost on that tangent focusing on the purpose moving forward to Medieval Times Thomas Aquinas basically came up with the idea of natural law this this kind of set the stage for moving more towards um intellectualism and empiricism and and even set the stage for for science basically he said that like humanity and things abide by some kind of natural law uh he he said that natural law was handed down by God but you know okay whatever moving forward to the Renaissance this was The Rebirth of learning of intellectualism and people during the Renaissance actually very deliberately went back and and cherry-picked stuff out of the Roman and Greek uh periods of time and this is also where they came up with the what we today call the University system which the the entire idea of the University was to create a universal man or someone who knows everything that there is to know at the time and actually one thing that I learned recently is that when universities first were created everyone took every class but we now of course there's too many classes you couldn't take everyone so you have to specialize uh moving forward beyond the Renaissance there's uh Enlightenment so the enlightenment was kind of a again a development of that where you you go from natural law to more uh intellectualism and then that's where we start to set the stage for empiricism rationalism and the invention of the scientific method so again we're moving away from the more uh religious View and towards a more secular view which will unpack again uh in a little bit moving forward into the 19th century this is where existentialism and nihilism first came to be as well as transcendentalism and Manifest Destiny so as people had a less and less religious worldview and a more secular world view that was anchored in the material world uh people are like well you know if the directives of our religion are less important than maybe like just we can do whatever we want and so nihilism and transcendentalism in my opinion are kind of two sides of the same coin nihilism says there is no meaning there is no purpose nothing has any intrinsic meaning and transcendentalism says go for it um and then moving into the 20th century uh existentialism like it was it kind of kept going down and it became absurdism but also we saw the uh creation of post-modernism which will unpack um in in a minute so anyways this is a very very high level snapshot of uh of the history of Western philosophy just to provide a little bit of historical context okay so now we need to really talk about the rise of secularism so the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution focused on human reason and Science and empirical evidence which also uh dovetailed with the decline of religious Authority uh we saw you know the the French Revolution was in part about the control of uh religion and the rejection of religion and France became very deliberately became a secular Nation uh America became a secular nation and and and since then most western Powers have become purely secular Nations uh not not entirely and not universally but by and large uh nation states have become more more secular this also dovetailed with a shift towards nihilism and so whether or not someone believes in nihilism or even knows what nihilism means uh this has become so deeply embedded and ingrained in Western Society um by virtue by extension of empiricism and other things because science is it well here the growth of materialist philosophies and science's inability to provide life's ultimate meaning science is not able to tell you why we exist what is our purpose but our our fixation our preoccupation with science means that by virtue of favoring science and empiricism and rationality we don't have an answer to Life's purpose why are we here you know and this of course Douglas Adams with Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy uh made a parody of this you know what is what you know uh life what is the meaning of life the universe and everything and the answer is 42. that is an absurdist take on uh the nihilistic crisis um and so it has just become so deeply embedded in our culture that we just kind of have this belief even Many religious people kind of are like yeah you know maybe um you know some people believe that they have some kind of cosmic meaning but even a lot of religious people nihilism is so deeply embedded in our uh society that you can't really Escape it uh and so this has this has had a few consequences in society uh namely the existential crisis searching for meaning in a secular world is really difficult and then of course it's there's a bunch of um uh moral relativism where it's like well your truth is different from my truth um there are no moral absolutes uh and so basically we've kind of shattered everything and there's no answers there's just pieces everywhere um and then so this ultimately it's a double-edged sword this is this is kind of the bottom line literally and figuratively the bottom line is that this freedom from religious Doctrine is a double-edged sword and on the one hand it liberates you from dogmatic thinking on the other hand it doesn't provide an answer and so then you're just kind of lost you throw off the shackles but now where do you go this is also called the problem of choice if you can choose to do anything how do you choose what to do and evidence is that human brains actually we don't do well when you have infinite Choice uh and so this gives rise to things like um in in uh in The Avengers when Loki says like Neil you you crave subjugation what he's actually tapping into is is is Humanity's inability to kind of choose for itself when we have too many options I'm not saying that that's like an absolute truth uh because many people can choose their own Direction but if everyone's going in different directions we kind of look like ants that have been scattered uh from an outside perspective and I'm not saying that that's a bad thing it it exploration is good anyways getting lost on a tangent okay death of meaning so here's here's the problem is that uh the need for meaning the idea that there is a cosmic meaning that there is a cosmic purpose a universal purpose is so deeply embedded in Western culture from 2000 years uh well actually six thousand years of Judaism two thousand years of Christianity and fifteen hundred fourteen hundred years of Islam the idea that there is a cosmic entity that confers meaning and purpose is so deeply embedded in our culture that whether or not you're religious you are completely inculcated in this narrative in this Grand narrative and it's impossible to break out of that until you are aware of that narrative and so the idea that there is some Cosmic truth is manifested in the pursuit of objective truth and morality the idea that well we can't escape the notion that God is the art is the ultimate Arbiter of Truth facts and morality and so then well if you get rid of God then then what gives out objective truth and morality uh and then this need for meaning is then continued to be sustained uh by virtue of uh all the philosophers who may or may not have been aware of their own cultural bias their own cultural upbringing because when you study Eastern philosophy in the history of China Japan Korea other places you see that like a lot of these narratives are just missing and their worldview is very different from ours um so then you have uh another point of conflict is scientific understanding uh basically under undermines all of those traditional uh narratives so for instance uh Charles Darwin with a theory of evolution completely challenges the idea of human exceptionalism which again remember that Many religious narratives say that humans are preordained by God to be special to be in God's image and it's like well there's not really any evidence of that other than the fact that we are apparently the smartest creatures on the planet um but okay we're also highly destructive so if we're modeled after God what does that say about God um you know and then psychology Freud young and everyone in the 20th century um basically and Neuroscience is like we actually don't know ourselves as well as we think we do we're not the rational creatures that we that we are a friend of mine from my writing group said we are purely emotional creatures who paper over our decisions uh post-facto with a veneer of logic and reason which it's like yeah that's about it um so we if if you think that you're irrational you're not you are an emotional creature that has a wallpaper of rationality over top a hot mess of emotions and and personal narratives and experience and ego uh and then of course physics cosmology quantum physics uh theory of gravity and all that stuff basically like what even is reality there's the measurement problem and so the more we learn the more any foundation any solid foundation of the notion of reality um or objective absolute truths uh is very difficult and so then this leads to the death of meaning uh through things like post-modernism which post-modernism uh came around in the 1960s if I remember correctly which basically said like all of our grand narratives all of our meta-narratives are not true everything that we think we know about the way the world works such as God created everything uh or that humans are exceptional basically that Western worldview started really crumbling in the 60s which in the grand scheme of things for philosophical movements that's a really short period of time and so all of the grand narratives about the stories that we tell ourselves about our place in the universe and why the universe exists and why and how and everything purpose meaning are all crumbling and eroding there's a lot of inertia which is why they're still here but uh with when as it's decaying it's not been replaced by anything and that leads us to where we are today post-modernism and post-truth era so uh post-modernism as simply put as I can is a is the philosophical and cultural movement that questions foundational assumptions and Grand narratives basically nothing is sacred everything it can be scrutinized uh and this uh basically creates relativism skepticism uh and in an ideal world uh promotes discourse but what happens with internet is we end up with Echo Chambers uh and so then it's like well my truth is different from your truth you know we can choose alternative facts so this is all a downstream effect of post-modernism um some of the uh most influential thinkers uh Dorito with deconstructionism focalt with power knowledge and um uh the concept of discourse saying that like hey the the importance of talking through things uh is is hi I think that that's actually too low level that's a tactic not a strategy and that's why I'm talking about post nihilism anyways uh so some of the key themes of post-modernism is the rejection of absolute truth and Universal morals this is that relativism that I was talking about which is you know your truth is different from my Truth uh I believe in alternative facts uh emphasis on local and specific narratives so this is what I mean by local and specific narratives where you can have a uh an epistemic tribe that believes one set of things like flat earthers that's an epistemic tribe that they they have their own set of beliefs and evidence and facts and narratives versus a more global perspective and then of course uh one of the things and this is what some people like Jordan Peterson complain about is the fluidity of identities if you throw out the rigid uh dogmatic way of thinking like there are only two genders there is you should only be heterosexual then of course you say okay well actually when you look closely at other cultures because it like it's it's really quite absurd when you look at people that are like anti-trans it's like look at any number of other cultures around the world that they just accept that gender fluidity is not a binary and they never have questioned it and so like then you have this very imperialistic Western White Man's Burden idea that it's like oh well I have to go civilize these other cultures because clearly they're uncivilized while I'm not even unpacking my own assumptions um so anyways uh one of the one of the benefits of postmodern and one of the other benefits of post-modernism is the uh is the recognition that there is no single narrative that Victorian uh Imperial England maybe didn't have have the right narrative uh and so then it's like well let's unpack some of the individual differences and marginalized groups and different ways of thinking but the other side of that coin is that if we respect everyone's different ways of thinking um some people can be very destructive or can just be willfully ignorant of uh facts and process and other things and they kind of create their own world view which again double-edged sword all right so some contemporary thinkers uh there's John vervacci uh who is uh he's the one who codified the meaning crisis um and one of the things that he says is uh you know again uh dialogue uh practice of authentic dialogue so he didn't invent that but he's carrying that torch which again dialogue that is why the internet exists right that's why we make YouTube videos and Twitter threads about this stuff and another thing is that uh he is grounded in cognitive science and ancient Traditions so this is a common theme and this is something that I even have in common with these guys but now uh I look at Western and Eastern traditions and I also have um knowledge and experience with um uh Traditions from the global South such as South America and Africa seraphim Rose he was an Orthodox Christian monk who wrote nihilism the root and of the revolution of the modern age uh oh boy yeah talk about someone who hasn't unpacked their own baggage this is someone who joined the postmodernist movement in the 50s the 40s 50s and 60s I believe but ended up an alcoholic uh literally like laying on the floor screaming because he was angry about being abandoned by God and so then he he he did a 180 and reverse course and became that Orthodox Christian Monk and saying ah this is clearly the solution because I feel better so basically he was unable to escape his uh cultural uh indoctrination let's say so he was not able to escape nihilism instead he had to go backwards and this is this is the danger of and this is why I'm bringing this up is because this is the danger of looking to the Past for answers you can get inspiration ideas from the past but Humanity cannot go backwards and of course this is another thing Jordan Peterson also advocates for going backwards he talks about the importance of myth and religious narratives again this is um basically standing in stark contrast to nihilism and post-modernism where it's like well we threw out all of these all of these Grand narratives all these meta narratives but maybe we should just go back to them and so of course like if you're just advocating to literally just go straight backwards uh that's not really going to work and then of course he emphasizes personal responsibility and the pursuit of truth but then of course when people pursue their own truth he says well not like that that's not what I meant you need to adhere to traditional uh Power structures and so these guys have not really moved forward and I'm not criticizing John vervacci I've watched some of this stuff um I just disagree with the direction forward but certainly some of these other guys I definitely disagree with um okay so the meaning crisis or what I call the nihilistic crisis it has four primary pillars first is childhood abandonment this is the universal experience of childhood trauma whether it's from mild emotional neglect to severe existential Terror all children experience these things at some point in time uh whether you know when children first become aware of death they often will have a bit of a crisis and then of course there are all parents fail in some ways right whether they are profoundly abusive parents or even well-meaning parents who just do something wrong uh for whatever reasons but all parents fail fall short of perfect in some ways and these failures are often reinforced and perpetuated and unaddressed due to whether it's religious narratives because a lot of religions a lot of churches will will basically instruct parents on the correct way of raising children their social paradigms there's family paradigms and then of course there's also intergenerational trauma uh which is very widespread in the world uh but anyways the result of childhood abandonment which again is a is an intrinsic part of life is that if it is not addressed if it is not corrected it will harm someone's sense of self-worth security uh and attachment uh but it also deeply changes their world view when it goes unaddressed the second pillar is social abandonment so what we see in today's society is that emphasis on personal responsibility rugged individualism and self-sufficiency and often this comes at the expense of or directly antagonistic to uh Community I can't rely on anyone else everyone else is an idiot I need to take care of myself because no one will help me and I'm not going to help anyone else that is the narrative that has emerged in part because of the post-modernist uh take on the the you know the grand getting rid of grand narratives we're not all Americans the American identity is gone right we don't look after each other because I don't know what my neighbor is up to I might not trust them they might disagree with me on politics or religion or whether or not we should allow abortions whatever right and so because of this because we are in a state of Crisis alienation and disconnection uh is is the norm this also is being driven by the fact that we are more of a global species than ever and so you can hop on the internet you can look on Twitter Youtube Tick Tock everywhere you can see horrible things happening around the entire world you can you know at a glance just scrolling through Reddit you can see awful things happening all over the world and you can see people with a fundamentally different worldview than you and so this just makes you kind of throw up your walls and say you know what the world is big and scary and confusing and I can't handle it right and that that's called mean world syndrome um this whole problem is exacerbated by the fact that we have primate brains that have just simply not yet fully evolved to be Global Citizens remember that uh as recently as a hundred years ago most people lived and died within 10 miles of where they were born uh and of course you know you might have read the newspaper but your newspaper was a local paper and you might have just a tiny trickle feed of global news through the newspaper and so you know two or three generations is not enough time for a species to evolve to really comprehend and develop the the cognitive uh faculties to be a global species and so this makes us paradoxically even though we're more connected than ever we saw this with Facebook Mark Zuckerberg had the idea of hey we create a social glue that allows everyone to communicate with everyone else but it actually had the opposite effect because in part we are just not ready to be a global species we need to be the pressure is on but this leads to the the perverse reaction of alienation disconnection and isolation the third pillar of the nihilistic crisis is Cosmic abandonment and so this basically means that no matter how far we look out into the universe we see a cold in different Cosmos this is a lonely universe that is apparently mostly empty uh not only that we've already had the rise of secularism the death of God and you know existential crisis and so in this cold uncaring and personal Universe not only do we feel uh isolated socially we feel isolated on a galactic scale we feel isolated on a cosmic scale and so this Paradox of being you know we've only got the Earth we've only got each other but we're not even talking to our neighbors anymore and so then we can feel completely alone at all levels starting from childhood uh up through uh teenage years adulthood and then even when we look further out into the universe we feel completely alone and so this ultimately leads to self-abandonment which is the overwhelming sense of Despair futility and fatalism that comes from not not ever finding relief from these abandonments from this nihilistic crisis that the Western World and really the entire world has found itself in uh it can lead to self-destructive behaviors uh such as addiction uh in all of its forms and self-harm of various forms as well um but then also it just leads to a loss of self-care self-love and self-compassion which can then um can reinforce the existential crisis because it's like well I don't care about myself because nobody else cares about me and we see this in when uh I actually got the the inspiration for self-abandonment by listening to people talk about um uh hustle culture right where people will just they'll literally brag about not getting enough sleep because they have to work so hard and I'm like why would you brag about hurting yourself in this way um and it you know you from a as the kids say these days it's copium right it's it's an attempt to cope but all of that copium is in response to this system of abandonment which is again rooted in these macroscopic changes that are literally centuries in the making which is why it took so long for me to unpack all of this to realize holy crap this was literally like 2 000 years in the making uh and certainly over the last 600 years of technological advancement has really accelerated it and so when you look at these Trends it was kind of inevitable that there would be a clash that there would be some kind of Crisis some kind of Turning Point Okay so the limitations of nihilism and moving beyond nihilism how do we chart our path forward so some people as I mentioned earlier Advocate going backwards uh now this is either not possible or not desirable because Society intrinsically does not just move backwards you can't unlearn the things that you have learned uh but also another problem so this is like being caught between a rock and a hard place moving forward is confusing and difficult and often painful if you don't know where you're going and why you might just stick where you are this is called the devil you know stay with the devil you know and it's like okay well right now sucks and I don't I definitely don't want to go backwards but I don't know or believe that I can go forward so I'm just going to stay right here this is also called learned helplessness learned helplessness is a huge feature of the nihilistic crisis so one solution that has been proposed is so-called optimistic nihilism so optimistic nihilism says ah yes you know where there is no such thing as you know there's there's no intrinsic meaning uh God is dead so that means I am free to create my own meaning but remember I talked about the problem of choice uh and so you know okay yes you are on an individual level able to create your own meaning but this doesn't replace everything that you lost with the nihilistic crisis so it does not fully address the pain and so therefore optimistic nihilism Falls well short of giving you a new narrative a new uh road map a new model of engaging with reality and the uh confusing as hell existence that we all face and so because we can't go backwards and because the current Solutions don't work by virtue of lack of any other choice we probably do have to go forwards and so this begs the question what comes after nihilism you know you can guess the post nihilism okay but what is post nihilism mean okay so let's on start to unpack post nihilism the central axiomen this is this was the Breakthrough that I had uh within the last couple weeks was what is the underpinning assertion the underpinning assertion of nihilism is that there is no intrinsic meaning meaning is meaningless uh but moving beyond that what I realized was that meaning is not actually necessary and I'll I'll tell you the story about how I came up with this uh but here's a few here's a high level Cliffs notes version of post nihilism uh first and foremost it challenges the traditional emphasis on Cosmic or societal meaning uh by saying that meaning is not necessary you say maybe it was a false pretense all along maybe that maybe we've got that that cultural baggage that historical baggage of cosmic meaning and we just need to kind of set that aside uh post nihilism emphasizes that your individual Journey rather than some Cosmic Journey or Cosmic purpose it values unique experiences and struggles so basically your experience is yours your journey is yours no one can take that from you and even regardless of whatever else is going on in the universe that is always yours your experience is always that uh the next thing is that it celebrates the transient moments of life and so you know one thing that's really scary when you think about it for a minute is all you have is the current ephemeral moment the version of you that was alive yesterday and thinking and breathing no longer exists you went to sleep your brain reset your memory State reset and yes you woke up today and your brain has structures to pull some of those memories back but the moment is gone all the sensations that you had yesterday last week last year all of that's gone and the future is uncertain and so all you have is the current ephemeral moment of existence and so when you when you think of it that way our entire existence exists on the edge of a knife it exists as a pinpoint in space and time and that is can be pretty unsettling um but when you when you understand that and you Embrace that's all you've got that is a big part of post-nihilism another thing is that we can we can find a lot of fulfillment and purpose in satisfying our basic human needs and drives and I'll unpack that more later uh it encourages also engaging your intrinsic curiosity and your intrinsic motivations your intrinsic drives uh that are that are rooted in your mind your biology and in your Evolution and one of the most important things is that while meaning is not necessary this doesn't say that meaning is irrelevant it doesn't say that meaning is undesirable all I'm saying with post nihilism is that meaning is not necessary it's not the highest order of goals or or purpose in life um you can still find meaning you can still find purpose but it's just not your number one priority okay so the origins of post-nihilism so I grew up in a secular home and when I was about four or five I was riding around with my dad and I asked as many precocious gifted children do why are we here like what does it all mean and my dad said basically there is no real reason like we're just we we just are here you know there's the Big Bang there's Evolution but there's no there's no overriding purpose there's no overarching narrative or meaning and so I was just like oh okay so I never had those grand narratives of of meaning and purpose and so I had uh from a very young age this radical acceptance of the intrinsic meaningless of life and so because I never grew up with that Cosmic meaning that need for Cosmic meaning it seemed really strange to me that other people didn't that's another reason why it took me so long to figure out that this is actually something that other people need and so fast forward more than 30 years or about 30 years I started writing my novel about four years ago and part of my novel was envisioning a post-scarcity hyperabundance society uh basically kind of forecasting like okay let's assume that artificial intelligence and nuclear fusion and all these new technologies solve all of our material problems if you get rid of all of our material material problems and all of the need to uh to work and everything what's left what philosophy would that Society need to adapt in order to be healthy because I wanted to Envision a Utopia like okay so what what what underpinning philosophy does a Utopia have obviously it's not going to be nihilism because nihilism is intrinsically self-destructive so if AI removes the need for human labor and effort and and all Need for struggle what is left and when in the pursuit of answering that question through I'm now on draft 13 of my novel um how do you move beyond that nihilistic crisis that we are presently mired in how do we get not just from a technical perspective from a cultural sociological and philosophical perspective how do we get from here to there how do we get from our current trend of dystopia to a state of Utopia that is the origin of post nihilism so some influences on post nihilism as I mentioned earlier in the video I I have studied uh cultures all over the all over the sorry all over the globe um in particular Eastern philosophy and culture uh and I found a lot of answers in Japanese culture and Japanese history so one of the key influences uh is wabi-sabi so wabi-sabi is the uh is a Japanese concept which literally you cannot translate to English it just it is untranslatable but what it does is it focuses on imperfection transience and incompleteness basically it acknowledges the passage of time and the Natural State of Decay that is just an intrinsic part of life uh and it's and this is why you see in many Japanese Aesthetics like things are decaying there's Moss covering everything stuff is is old and at the same time the Japanese tend to rebuild stuff because of this deeply embedded acceptance of the passage of time and of Decay and destruction of transients and imperfection and it's like okay well uh you know the house has fallen down so let's just build a new one this radical acceptance of mortality of age of Decay is very deeply embedded in Japanese culture another concept is Ichigo Ichi which is uh translates roughly to one-time one meaning so this came from uh this is uh exemplified by the the tea ceremonies from Japan but again it has to do with not just awareness and but embracing and appreciating that ephemeral fleeting nature of reality that every moment is unique rather than trying to think of permanence and Grand narratives it just says this moment right now is good or bad or whatever but that radical acceptance of that transient ephemeral nature and just saying like yes this is beautiful right here um uh Shinto is the is a spiritual Philosophy from uh from ancient Japan uh and it has the concept of coming which Kami is often translated to God because that's like the closest ish word but Kami means many things but it does not mean god um it may it might mean Divine not in a deity sense but it it might mean Divine in terms of the sublime and the awe-inspiring within the context context of the mundane world in other words Kami does not have to do with Celestial Origins it has more to do with um the Majesty of nature of Life of experience and so in in that respect we are surrounded by Kami at all times but in particular during those those um those Peak experiences in life and then of course I also studied Zen Buddhism for many years uh which uh one of the most important lessons from Zen Buddhism is radical acceptance challenging assumptions and then Letting Go those are three of the biggest pillars of Zen Buddhism uh which again uh dovetails actually very nicely with post-modernism uh particularly challenge challenging assumptions and letting go of uh baggage so I took Western philosophy and Eastern philosophy and then shamanic experiences from the global South and all of that came together to make post-nihilism okay so the journey from nihilistic crisis to post nihilism is primarily about letting go of the demand for meaning and what I mean by meaning is capital M meaning so challenge the necessity of meaning question whether or not the need for meaning has been a false pretense all along it's been a false narrative all along thing to keep in mind is that the Universe hasn't changed in all of human existence from since before religion existed until long after we're gone the universe like yes it might be changing and evolving but the fundamental precepts of the universe haven't changed only our perception has changed only our beliefs have changed and so if that's true maybe you know the the 2000 or so years of the idea of cosmically imbued purpose maybe that was a lie all along and so then another way to unpack that is realize that the The Narrative of meaning is just words it's been put down in books it's been put down in religion it's been put down in stories but it's still just a narrative it's just a construct it's a social construct and that without it if you unpack and kind of go to a primordial state it was never there in the first place and so then moving beyond is uh and letting go it's not just about discarding the need for meaning but you have to advance towards something else right as I mentioned earlier the problems with post-modernism is that it's shattered every narrative and then didn't replace it with anything else and so then you're just kind of lost um and so in that respect let it moving beyond nihilism towards post nihilism is not just about rejection it's not just about destroying the old way it is also about growth and reformation and moving towards something else and then finally uh moving towards that state of postnilism getting rid of the demand for meaning is about embracing your individual experience it's your journey it's your struggles and your challenges and by wrapping yourself in that and by saying you know yes this is my life and there's a million things that I would change about it but this is mine and I can't get off this ride right and that's not like throwing your ends up in giving up it's just saying wow this struggle that I'm going through it sucks but this struggle is part of the purpose or part of how I can find my own purpose or whatever and then appreciating that transience and that uniqueness of those individual moments of those ephemeral moments in reality and then replace the demand for universal meaning with a focus on those personal moment-to-moment uh bits of significance in search of the sublime in search of experiencing uh you know the awe-inspiring uh the moments of Kami as the Japanese might say and so then when you change your orientation to be really deeply anchored in the moment in the ephemeral moment and focusing on your own Journey rather than Cosmic narratives those those false constructs then life really changes for you and I what I what I will tell you is that when I had this breakthrough personally like I was it was just on repeat in my in my head like as I was trying to go to sleep like it's all about my journey my journey it's all about like meaning is not necessary it was just on repeat as my mind was like recalibrating itself to fully uh to fully vest into post-nihilism okay so I know this is a wall of text um by the way you can download this whole thing I'll show you the link at the end of the video um here are some Downstream principles some derivative principles from post nihilism and this is not an exhaustive list this is still a work in progress obviously it can take decades to fully articulate a philosophical movement and by that time it's probably going to be irrelevant anyways and by the way I do not anticipate that post nihilism is going to last forever this is just the next phase of our philosophical growth so first is embracing the ephemeral I've talked about that quite a bit so but it's you know life is seen as a series of unique unrepeatable moments each valuable in its own right there you have it intrinsic motivation so basically intrinsic motivation is looking at uh like the the your inner reasons for doing any things whether it's pleasure whether it's satisfaction uh you're just innate biological drives or whatever you know your own desire for meaning or purpose rather than some extrinsic uh motivation right because God said so that's what I mean by extrinsic versus intrinsic your individual Journey which already uh talked about quite a bit so I don't need to belabor that point rejection of cosmic necessity again remembering that uh that these Cosmic narratives might have been false in the first place biological grounding whatever else is true your brain does not separate from your body your mind is not separate from your body uh yes you might make the argument that like okay we have a soul and there's some evidence that you know your brain follows energetic patterns and responds to things that are not fully grounded in your body but the rest of your body is still grounded in physics and reality and so when you look at uh at some of the Frameworks that I'll uh pitch in just a second there are some Universal truths about being a human animal that uh really for me offered a tremendous amount of guidance a holistic approach so again rather than trying to separate out philosophy and mind from body and material like we are a complete entity in a complex world and so rather than trying to look at philosophy in a vacuum uh I advocate for looking at philosophy in life and existence holistically which is our place in relation to all that and within it and then finally challenged his transcendental narratives pretty much the same thing as rejection rejection of the cosmic narratives um but the idea of trans and rejecting transcendental narratives is like the idea that there's some external Force providing meaning that whether or not that external force is outside of the cosmos itself a hyper-cosmic entity um or if it's just completely abstract um and but basically it says let's let's stay rooted in our lived experience okay so here are some helpful Frameworks um the most famous One Maslow's hierarchy of needs uh these are these Frameworks are pretty Universal they transcend cultural boundaries and they reveal some Universal truths about being human and while you might want to say oh well philosophy and reason and logic exist outside of humanity I kind of don't think so and I didn't have a slide about this but as I uh engage with the concept of emergence emergent complexity the existence of humanity and minds and thought is not a foregone conclusion in this universe and so therefore when you look at the fact that like okay life came to be and that might have been an accident it emerged it was not necessarily uh an automatic thing so the complexity of Life emerged from the underlying rules and systems of the universe and then from Life emerged intelligence and then that emerged Consciousness and all those other things and so the idea that there is something above us is not true it's all below us we are already at the top of complexity as as far as I can tell and so from that it's like okay well instead of looking up look down so you start with the physiological and safety and love and belonging and blah blah blah and then you know self-actualization realizing your full potential and then Transcendence basically this is this is where optimistic nihilism still kind of applies which is like ah well in order for me to reach my own maximum potential this is the direction I can choose I don't necessarily agree with Transcendence um or looking at it through the lens of optimistic nihilism another thing is uh self-determination Theory um so self-determination theory is actually a simpler framework than Maslow's hierarchy of needs has to do with belonging Mastery and autonomy so you know belonging which is love and belongingness and also esteem your place in society uh Mastery also has to do with esteem but Mastery also has to do with self-actualization and Transcendent which is like basically being the best that you can be right this is an intrinsic human motivation and then finally autonomy so autonomy is something that is not reflected in maso's hierarchy of needs but is basically autonomy is the ability the freedom to um to act according to your own desires and your own goals Choice Theory by William Glasser is a framework that has five points so survival love power freedom and fun you can see a lot of a lot of similarity so like power is similar to Mastery freedom is similar to autonomy fun fun is a is is an interesting thing to add because that's not reflected here either survival that's reflected here under physiological and safety so it's pretty similar to those two then love you know so love and belongingness um and then Walsh's therapeutic lifestyle changes so Roger Walsh created this framework this TLC framework that has eight points and so uh basically it's you know how to be healthy so you know get enough exercise get good nutrition spend time in nature um have you know invest in your relationships have good relationships uh get re have Recreation so enjoyable Hobbies that's fun um relaxation and rest so that is you know having a recovery time spirituality so engaging with something bigger than yourself and then uh commute a service acts of service or community service giving back to The Human Condition so these four Frameworks are very very helpful and the the reason that I I advocate for these Frameworks and another reason that I say that this is different from optimistic nihilism is because optimistic nihilism throws the baby out with the bathwater along with nihilism it says there is no meaning there is no purpose there is no reason but that's not actually true because we're at the end of the day you're still human you still have physiological needs you still have a brain you still have millions of years of evolution guiding who and what you are today and these Frameworks for me have been incredibly useful for figuring out what to do and I actually forgot to include ikigai which is a Japanese framework for how to find meaning and purpose um so look up ikigai I should have a link in the comments okay so moving forward criticisms of post-nihilism uh one thing that you might say is like okay well if you just say uh meaning is not necessary that's like that's a cop-out right maybe you're just giving up um but it's not giving up it's not saying oh well just throw the you know throw your hands up and give up it's just a change in perspective to say maybe the need for meaning is the wrong narrative maybe some of these other Frameworks like ikigai and Maslow's hierarchy of needs maybe that is actually how I pursue a more meaningful fulfilling life uh potential for misinterpretation um the central Axiom meaning is not necessary you can take that a lot of different directions um but starting there you know it's like okay well and again like I said it can take decades to fully articulate a philosophical movement and by no by no stretch of the imagination do I entertain the delusion that I'm going to control the entire thing I'm just introducing the concept um so maybe the maybe uh you know like previous philosophical movements um you know the things that I articulate will then be misinterpreted or misconstrued deliberately or otherwise who knows now here's an interesting one challenges to traditional masculinity this is some feedback that I've gotten where it's like well as a man I need a purpose I need a mission in life and I actually agree with this um I talked to some Modern masculinists and healthy masculinists and I absolutely agree I don't know if this is true for women but certainly for men having a mission in life is one of the best ways to have a sense of purpose a sense of meaning and a sense of self-esteem I know what my mission is my mission is very clear um now that being said I'm not putting the need for meaning first I came to my mission by looking at who I am and what I am capable of and what I care about it's very egocentric in that respect and so what I want to say is that post nihilism is not a threat to masculinity it actually clears a lot of the path for traditional masculinity and healthy masculinity and I'll unpack that in the next slide um another criticism could be that it is difficult to implement especially given all the cultural baggage that we've got it took me literally years to unpack all the cultural baggage that I got knowingly and unwittingly um from my family from the society from messages and media and that sort of thing uh and so like whether you're looking for markers of material success conspicuous consumption um you know existing narratives right there's a lot there's a lot of um a lot of inertia kind of keeping us where we're at um so changing directions takes a lot of energy another possible criticism is uh potential for complacency so what what I mean by this is that if you say well meaning isn't necessary then it's like okay well maybe nothing is necessary and that's actually Fair that's a fair criticism because for some people if you say well there is no Grand purpose there is no Grand meaning there is no uh Cosmic narrative maybe all I want to do is just play video games and you know what that's fine if someone wants to do that that's their life that's their choice that's their journey and so yes some people might take it to a place and just be lazy but you know what I don't care let them do it um you know as uh as George Carlin once said he's like show me show me someone sitting around uh you know hitting a bong and touching himself and I'll show you someone who's not causing any trouble George Carlin was actually uh very secretly I think a post-nihilist um or absurdist he was on the edge of post nihilism but he was still very much mired in absurdism but he had a point um show me show me someone who's doing nothing with his life except smoking pot and playing video games and I'll show you someone who's not causing any trouble um and then finally Reliance on intrinsic motivation um I do emphasize intrinsic motivation and of course there there will always be some extrinsic motivations as well right uh climate change uh economics the need to work in order to get money uh in order to feed yourself or whatever but with all that aside there is we all have plenty of intrinsic motivation hunger right hunger will drive you to do a lot of stuff loneliness will drive you to do a lot of stuff those those Frameworks that I showed those are that is a those are very comprehensive Frameworks about your intrinsic needs and desires and biological imperatives and so because you have those needs some of the struggles and your journey is inevitable you're gonna have to feed yourself one way or another unless you just sit there and starve to death right and so by by looking at the ground truth of what remains true at all times for All Humans um then you can still say like okay well yes maybe we get rid of those Cosmic narratives those extrinsic motivations there's plenty of interesting motivation for everyone to go around okay and I wanted to uh share this this idea um to reinforce the idea that post nihilism does not intrinsically run contrary to traditional masculinity and so I picked one of the most over-the-top uh hyper masculine uh role models of all time Teddy Roosevelt um so Teddy Roosevelt for some background um he suffered severe asthma as a child he was incredibly frail timid and anxious but through uh hard work exercise and challenging himself he became what he called a bull moose so he's a real tough guy and he invented this philosophy um called the strenuous life which you know promoted hard work perseverance and physical toughness and he was also incredibly energetic um he advocated for for confronting life's challenges head on rather than seeking comfort in ease and what I realized as I've learned about Teddy Roosevelt is that because he struggled so much he he just became so comfortable with the challenge with his own journey of overcoming Anxiety and his timidity and his Frailty and so as he he just as a as a default set of behaviors and beliefs it's like well he could wallow in anxiety and um and Frailty or he could fight it and so then um through through that transformative experience he basically with the strenuous life he was describing his own life his own life was strenuous and he developed that sense of tenacity um by by confronting his own struggles and construct and confronting his own uh problems and overcoming them and so uh while uh you know post nihilism uh does talk about your individual Journey your individual experience and finding value in that in the in that which is uniquely yours that is why I picked this to say that if the strenuous life resonates with you which a friend of mine uh it it does he's he's a member of TSL if it resonates with you that is fine like that is one model I'm not saying that the strenuous life is the only model of post-nihilism I'm just saying it is a pro-masculinity uh model of life that dovetails very nicely with uh post nihilism and so again it has that emphasis on your individual journey and your individual challenges um and so with all that being said um meaning is not necessary I hope you got a lot out of this I hope that this helped prime the pump and will get you thinking about uh how humanity is changing and will continue to change um in light of all the cultural and philosophical and technological changes that we're going through thanks for watching cheers
