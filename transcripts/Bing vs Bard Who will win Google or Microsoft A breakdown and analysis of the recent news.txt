morning everybody David Shapiro here with a breakdown so yesterday we had Microsoft with their Bing announcement and demonstration and this morning we had Google with Bard and then some so uh let's break this down uh in case you haven't seen it yet uh there was a nice little demo of of Bing where you can ask about uh you know getting a dog and then you basically get a chat GPT like output but it does cite its sources which is really cool so I get the impression that there's a little bit more going on behind the scenes where they're probably doing uh integrating search results and citing their sources as they go which is really good um having using the internet as a source of declarative knowledge good on you um there's still going to be gaps in this but we don't have to take a deep dive into that so uh if you get on it you can expand it uh I don't know I don't know how broadly available this is yet uh of course it's also just the first release it's going to be improved over time uh but as an initial showing it's like okay cool this is basically chat GPT directly in your browser with citations sorted or citations uh provided rather not sorted um now today though Google had their expected announcement of Bard but they went above and beyond so they had a lot on visual search with Google Lens as well as Google Maps both of those are roughly the same kind of thing where it's about being in the real world and more visual data Google immersive view in maps looks incredible so they use a new technology called Nerf or a neural Radiance field there's a great video on this from corridor through which I definitely recommend you check out I think it was about four two or two to four months ago anyways uh I told a friend of mine uh about six or seven months ago that that neural representations were going to be the way of the future we were talking about deep fakes and then neural Radiance Fields come out which is basically I think that neural Radiance fields are going to completely change the way that we do movies uh film TV uh it it's interactive as well so this could change the way that we do games I think the future is neural representations and Google nailed it they stuck The Landing with the immersive view on maps you can actually go in and walk through in in fully rendered 3D any locations that they have with the neural Radiance fields um and then they had this uh these little opera singing blobs uh for their their arts and culture aspect and uh we'll get it will get a little bit more into this in the future but I also think that we are seeing the very beginning of AI generated entertainment um the combination of generative AI in in the form of large language models uh uh text image text to video uh text audio in this case these these opera singers are all completely synthesized um and then also neural representations for interactive aspects such as neural Radiance Fields when we'll get a little bit more into that um with a with a nice little Hidden Gem at the end of the video so stick around until the end um where I talk about where this is going Okay so I uh I did a little poll I did one on Twitter and YouTube uh now there is obviously some bias in this because uh people that follow me are more likely to uh see this poll and reply but on both platforms Google was chosen as the clear winner uh of this fight um with 70 on on YouTube and 62 on Twitter now I have way fewer followers on Twitter so this is probably a more fair representation whereas uh my followers on YouTube are going to be familiar with uh uh some of my prior prior beliefs around cognitive architecture and so on which is why I favor Google uh if I were a betting man now um so General consensus seems to be that Google has about a two to one uh advantage over Microsoft with Bing we'll be curious to see how these numbers change after today I suspect this is going to tip a little bit more in the favor of Google uh one thing that came up in this poll though was that a bunch of folks were saying we are going to see a paradigm shift in the way that we approach the internet and web and and so on and I've I've had people recommend all kinds of things like we're going to see a new layer of abstraction where instead of websites we're going to have a different uh you know like the chat or another kind of way of interacting with the internet we're going to have entirely new AI experiences uh there's going to be a third party an underdog maybe an open source solution so there is some energy around hey maybe AI is going to completely change the landscape I'm not sure that I am in that camp just yet because when you look at the people that are best equipped to adapt to this change it's going to be the ones that are one leading the research and two have the money to Pivot and Microsoft and Google have both of those in Spades remember that it was Google who started this with their paper their original papers on Transformers back in what 2016 um and that has led to the current Revolution uh so they've been here for years Microsoft is technically still playing catch-up although open AI is a little bit ahead you know but in the grand scheme of things Microsoft and Google are neck and neck in this technology they're they're leading the charge and setting the tone so I think that they are probably going to be the preeminent uh players when it comes to Ai and neural networks and particularly search as well as some of these other Technologies uh such as the digital avatars and so and and and voice and image generation now I did however start another poll based on some of those responses because I was curious uh is search toast maybe they're on to something maybe we will see the death of conventional search through you know your search bar it could entirely be that search is going the way of the dinosaurs after all younger younger folks these days gen Z they're more likely to use tick tock to search which that still blows my mind um you know because it's like Tick Tock is a Chinese platform that is designed to be addictive I don't know why you would want to use that for information foraging purposes um but hey it is what it is um so anyways the results here were mixed now to be fair there's only 162 votes total between these two but they are opposite between Twitter and YouTube so search is here forever roughly 50 50 with searches toasted maybe we will see a paradigm shift where people are just not going to use search anymore imagine you know people there's already people using replica uh their chat bot imagine that you have an app on your phone that is your personal information concierge and all you do is chat with that that's honestly what I want I don't want to cruise Reddit which is going to give me you know depressing information and doom scrolling I want to have a meaningful conversation with an intelligent entity that can tell me like the no one knows what I care about like you know nuclear fusion and mRNA and Rejuvenation therapies and Singularity and AI I want to have something that goes and finds the information that I want and hand delivers it to me and can have a conversation now Google News already does that I get most of my news by swiping um swiping left on my Android phone and it has a curated news feed that is already pretty well custom tailored to what I want to know about so you slap Google barred on that and that is going to be the primary way that I interact with the internet so it's an it is possible that search is going the way of the dinosaurs search as we know it obviously search is still there but maybe there is something to this idea that we're going to have another layer on top of it and then of course you know these tools cite their sources so then if I have Google bard or another uh you know Bing or whatever that I'm interacting with and it's and I'm talking to it about news a social landscape whatever what are my friends up to um you know who should I what friends should I call today you know go read their Twitter feeds for me or whatever um you know it is possible that we're going to go that way there's no consensus which is really interesting to me is I thought it would be like really obvious like people are saying no AI is going to completely replace search or no search is obviously going to stay um if there's mix if the results are this mixed I think it's going to be both right this is a false dichotomy it's a false choice but I thought these results were very interesting so I wanted to share okay so let's do a breakdown uh a pros and cons view of Microsoft so Bing had a good showing um they had a good live demo uh it obviously works it is a little bit on the slow side which they addressed um or maybe it was some of the some of the interviews addressed um I watched an interview with Satya Nadella um and he's got a very clear-headed approach to wanting to take a larger market share of of search and I think that being with AI will do that especially since uh chat GPT and gpt3 are going to be integrated across Microsoft's landscape they're already rolling out teams premium with chat GPT built in I have had the privilege of speaking with various teams and product owners throughout Microsoft um they the the entire organization at Microsoft is working on integrating uh GPT Technologies um and so we are going to see business software very quickly pivot to be truly like 21st century or AI based Microsoft has Windows which runs desktop PCS gaming and server infrastructure um so I can imagine that uh businesses are going to really benefit from AI integration above and beyond just Bing now another Pro in the in the uh column for Microsoft is they can afford to lose the search War Microsoft has so many other business segments they are like a uh they're like a a federation or A Confederacy of business units all of which provide value whereas Google is monolithic 70 I think it's 70 to 90 percent of Google's revenue comes from search so and we'll get into that in just a minute now that being said the cons on Microsoft side is that it was a pretty anemic showing they had one basically one product um and it kind of felt like a half-hearted attempt it really reminds me of Zune where Microsoft has really really always struggled to break into the b2c market or the consumer Market uh think about their competition with apple apple has had a very coherent consumer ecosystem for a long time with iTunes iPhone ever you know I everything um Microsoft has really struggled with that the only exception being Xbox right with their gaming platform and and how Central Microsoft Windows has been to desktop gaming and then of course some console gaming of course the console Market is a little bit different uh because you've got you know PlayStation is still a major player uh and a handful of others um but you know you've also seen others go the way the dinosaurs Sega got out of the console they only produce games now so anyways uh I that's that's kind of that's kind of the high level overview pros and cons for Microsoft so now let's look at Google uh how the last couple days how does their showing Stack Up in terms of pros and cons the biggest Pro is they brought a huge portfolio of products uh to to share they they addressed arts and culture they addressed navigation maps translation uh entertainment they had so much to going for them um uh Google has mobile they have Android who has a Windows phone I don't think they even make Windows phones anymore um so Android is going to be a huge huge Boon for Google in deploying access to these whether it's Bard or any of these other things such as lens Maps we like you can get by without a laptop or desktop today you can get by with just a smartphone or a tablet um which means that Android uh is incredible for for Google Now Google also has Chrome the most used browser globally so regardless of whether or not you're using a Windows server or Windows desktop you're probably using Chrome that or Firefox right um oh I actually have some folks that I'm going to be talking to at Mozilla about trustworthy AI so keep uh keep your eyes peeled for that video coming up if they let me talk about it obviously I honor ndas there's plenty of stuff that I know that I am not sharing um because you know I like when people share stuff with me uh but anyways getting distracted point being is Google has Android and Chrome which uh that's a tough nut to crack and I don't think that being with AI alone is going to dislodge and and dislodge uh Chrome because Edge is like okay sure but what else right uh whether or not it's trusted you know Edge is now the fastest way to download Chrome and Firefox right or whatever else you want to use um so Google also has an established dominance in brand trust where it comes to search we just trust Google results and trust is one of those things that Google has managed to maintain when other Tech giants like meta AKA Facebook lost trust and is now imploding um ditto for Tesla uh so Google has managed to maintain trust to be fair Microsoft has maintained trust as well just not with some of their products namely Edge Cortana because they have a long history of failed products that they just didn't really seem to invest in um now uh this is both a pro and a con for Google is they cannot afford to lose this so it is a pro in the fact that they can't they can't afford to lose it so they're going to go all in right they Google will intrinsically put more energy and money into winning the search War than Microsoft will because Microsoft can afford to lose it so there may be they might you know have a foray just like how zun tried to compete with iPods and they're like okay well that didn't really work they Microsoft did the same thing with with Windows phone they wanted to compete with iPhone it didn't really work so they let it go right so the core business of Microsoft and Google is different but because of that Google really cannot afford to lose this this war now they also lost Tempo and initiative as I mentioned earlier Google created the technology that is driving this revolution they started this trend in 2016 which is what seven years ago right and this came back to bite them too so I'm one thing that I'm concerned about is uh and and uh people in the alignment spaces are talking about this now is that there's this there's this frigidness that's kind of settling on to open source which is the big players like Google deepmind Microsoft open AI they have published research and there's a lot of takers both in the corporate space but also in the International Space and so I'm wondering if this is going to cause a lot of the tech Giants to clam up and switch from open source to closed Source uh because something as innocuous as the Transformer Innovation and the uh and the the um and the lost signals all the algorithmic improvements that allowed for the current wave of AI what if Google hadn't if they what if Google had realized what they had seven years ago and kept it all closed Source like that would be bad for all of us but it would be really good for Google so that's one thing that I'm concerned about and that's why I posted that as a con not necessarily for Google but for all of us is the possibility that we're going to get this this really uh kind of hostile environment and we're gonna get rid of Open Source so here's my here's my personal conclusions Google is the hands down winner up front for now uh the in the long run the lines might break down over B to B which is business to business versus B to C or business to customer Microsoft their core business has always been B2B software business software Google they're better in the consumer space so they might ultimately just kind of stick with their Core Business another uh takeaway is Google must go all in on AI and that means pivoting their entire organization if they have to they just laid off 12 000 more people um so you know they're gonna pivot they have to if they want to survive they will need to go all in Google has a much broader range of offerings on B2B or sorry b2c with their Android and chrome platforms as one of the primary uh delivery mechanisms but Microsoft has a much more comprehensive B2B portfolio with Microsoft Office server Azure and everything else so again they're probably going to end up playing in their own sandboxes just as they have been um one thing that was missing from this was gaming and AI assistance uh like why didn't Microsoft say anything about Xbox like are they not gonna like create a you know realistic NPCs that you can have real conversations with that's what I think is really missing from this conversation so I promised earlier that we were going to touch on that so here's the last two slides of this presentation keep an eye on Nvidia Omniverse I don't know why Nvidia is not getting more attention if you go watch their omniverse videos for audio to face and their Ace their uh Avatar Cloud engine it is super impressive um you combine the conversational ability of chat GPT and large language models with this stuff you add a little bit more sophistication in you've got completely interactive uh avatars that can you know be whatever you need them to be whether it's gaming whether it's news whether it's teachers like oh man I've had some conversations with the folks over at Nvidia I am excited for them I don't think Nvidia yet realizes what they've got and so I want to wrap this up with something that's a little bit more abstract for the infrastructure people uh is uh nvidia's unified Computing framework that is a really boring Bland name but this is this is the underpinning technology that will allow for all of these other things to be delivered and matured and consumed and so I think that Nvidia might be that Underdog that people were talking about on on Twitter because all the Plug and Play stuff and I I definitely encourage you go look up Nvidia Ace and UCF watch the videos this stuff is really impressive this is going to allow anybody so you see the low code design tools sample applications all of it is they've got it nice and layered it's got a nice graphical user interface and it's also incredibly powerful this is coming it's coming fast and I think that Nvidia probably will be able to Corner this Market but the biggest thing is is I think that Nvidia sees themselves as the underdog they're very much acting like the underdog where they're like ah we're big but we're not going to compete with Google and Microsoft I think that Nvidia has the capacity to carve out a huge huge chunk of the market if they position themselves right and have the vision so thank you for watching we are in the hilarious timeline now take care
