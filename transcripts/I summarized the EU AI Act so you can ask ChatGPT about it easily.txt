I think we're ready to begin um he saw me look at the camera used to be over there now you're over here okay so I ran a poll uh 17 hours ago I asked if you all wanted me to do a video on the euai ACT man got names gotta get better with names I'm good with acronyms come to me for acronyms gato Gaia Aegis okay anyways so y'all were confused about what I meant by Haas which is something from here in the South basically Haas means just something big right it's short it's a southern dialect for a horse or in particular a big horse um so this document is a Haas because look how freaking long it is it just keeps going so I plugged it in over here and it is uh 70 000 tokens long so even if I had access to uh GPT 432k which I did briefly and then they revoked it I think they got overwhelmed uh because I used it I tried to use uh GPT uh 432k on a couple things and it was just like server is overloaded servers are anyways so hopefully I get that back but the idea was there would be I could read it and you know chop it up into maybe four sections uh three or four sections and read the whole thing but we don't have that and I do have uh GPT 3.5 turbo 16k0613 so this model is actually super super steerable it is actually better than original gpt4 at a lot of things um it's still kind of dumb especially if the instructions are too complex but as long as you give it just one task uh GPT 3.3.5 turbo 0613 the June 13th model um is more than adequate for most things now that being said because I'm interpreting legalese and I'm doing summarization I'm going to use 04 613. So the instructions that I gave it just now and I know that I'm ready to start the video primary purpose zoom in a little bit the primary purpose or the following is a chunk of legislation your job is to summarize this legislative legislation with two primary goals one drastically reduce the word count and two retain enough context that it will still make sense the reason for this is the current AI technology can only read chunks that are so big method the user will give you a chunk of legislation via chat your response must only be the summarized version do not chat with the user engage with them or offer any other commentary summarize only so I copied the first hundred lines of the legislation into here and this is what it spit out so it took all that and just said okay this is what it means so the first hundred lines which you can see here so we've got 344 000 characters 3665 lines of stuff to go through I'm not going to read the whole thing I'm not AI explained uh that dude just like y'all are impressed with how much work I can do I'm impressed with how much that dude can read just honestly I'm maybe he uses chat GPT I don't know anyways if you're watching it's just a joke um okay so anyways uh so ultimately basically that that first hundred lines uh was summarized and condensed down to the European commission proposes a regulation for harmonized rules on artificial intelligence aiming to balance the socioeconomic benefits of AI with potential risks The Proposal seeks to ensure AI systems are safe respect fundamental rights provide legal certainty for investment in Innovation enhance governance and prevent Market fragmentation so it has says nothing about existential risks or prevent AI from killing everyone it's sort of implicit because like if AI kills everyone you can't have investment in Innovation but I would rather see legislation that is explicit it proposes a risk-based approach prohibiting certain harmful AI practices and setting requirements for high-risk AI systems okay cool we'll see how they Define that later The Proposal also establishes a governance system at member state level and a European artificial intelligence board at Union level Okay cool so this is this is going to be an international regulator great it is consistent with existing Union legislation and policies including data protection consumer protection non-discrimination and gender equality so these are all very low level risks none of this is actually talking like when they say high risk they're probably meaning like the social credit system uh that is used in China which that is a high risk but it is not the highest risk The Proposal is based on article 114 of the Treaty of the functioning of the European Union Union the tfeu which ensures The Establishment and functioning of the internal Market okay so this is mostly a market-oriented piece of legislation great so we know that this works so let's go ahead and save this out I'm going to walk you through the whole process um and then I'll yeah so this is this is how this is how we're going to proceed for those of you that are newer to my channel this is actually the original format that I used where I would where I would walk you through the entire process so just watched it on 2X and you'll see the whole process of how I approach these things so we'll call this system summarize yes dot text and so basically I give it a system a system message with very very clear instructions uh and and what I expect and and what it should expect and then it gives you very clear consistent results so then we come over to um Step One simplify so this is I'm just re I'm borrowing code uh which I always do um so we've got this so this is what we're going to use to do that um this is this is this is a KB service that I'm working on so I'll show you that in an upcoming video um but you don't get to see that yet we don't need KB functions so delete that flask routes we're not going to do a flask app so that's also fine actually I guess I just delete most of it okay cool so we get rid of flask because we're not going to do that we're not going to do threading We're Not Gonna we don't need flask or logging or Json or yaml okay clean it up I probably should have done that before I started the video but it's good to it's good for you to see how messy my process is um I am the first person to tell you I am not a professional developer I never was my uh professional background was I was uh in virtualization and automation so I'm an automation engineer which is why I approach things the way that I do which is creating discrete steps um so you notice the FI the title of this is uh step one simplify um Okay cool so basically what we're going to do is we're going to ask this handy dandy uh coding chat bot that I built which you can use this it is available over here um I had a bunch of people submitting um uh uh pull requests and they kept trying to like change the way that this thing works so I just set it to public archive so here's the thing is I welcome pull requests that are like simple fixes or small improvements don't refactor my code just Fork it right like there's 19 Forks if you want to if you want to fundamentally change how it works fine um but I got tired of people messing up my code so I just set it to public archive and guess what like people you can still do whatever you want with it anyways so we're going to use this as a co-pilot tool because I got frustrated with GitHub because they're co-pilot uh customer service whatever documentation is garbage okay uh let's see I have um here let's just write a function that accepts um a gigantic string and returns um let's see and let's see splits it by lines and then chunks um 100 lines uh together and returns uh those chunks as strings so um the final result will be um a list of strings each string represents 100 lines of the original okay so this is this is my coding chatbot assistant that um it uses it also uses gpt4 um you I I tried it you can actually switch it to um oh it's using the old one hold on now I need to update that hold on hold on that's the wrong model coding chatbot assistant see this is what I mean is someone someone updated it oh no my local one uses the right one so someone updated it with the wrong model and made a bunch of other assumptions and I was just like no this is not this is not what I wanted okay so here we go here's the function python chunk strings line lines equals split oh wow I did it in two lines cool um this functions first splits the string into lines using the delimiter then it uses a list comprehension to create chunks of 100 lines each the range yep the result is a list of strings cool excellent excellent excellent so I'm going to go ahead and copy this out oh and another good thing is that uh like well yeah you see how it works all right so we'll go ahead and do that so chunk strings so first we want to just um act equals open file and I've got it named as act.txt just right here um yep oh and also this uh excuse me this this uses a scratch Pad so what I can do is I can actually populate the code that I'm working on uh over here so now it's aware of what I'm working on so this scratch Pad is a holdout so rather than giving it the code in sequence the the coding chat bot actually has a uh it has here let me show you the system message so here's the instructions your python coding assistant let me turn on word wrap your python coding assistant etc etc scratch Pad so basically tells you the scratch Pad is usable you know so that you know what the user is working on um so that you can talk about this and this is passed to the chat bot every time so whatever the conversation is like that that is in the past um I don't know if I'm explaining that well anyways point being is that it see it can see the code that you're working on as long as you keep this updated um okay so that's the first hundred lines um let's go ahead and see where did it go step one simplify um cool so act equals that and then we'll say chunks equals uh let's see chunk string chunk string act all right so this this basically creates the chunks that we're going to be working on um and that is that let's see I'm gonna need to watch this because um well here let me just show you something real quick so the first hundred lines if we take that over to playground and paste it in here you see that 100 lines is about four thousand tokens so that would obviously be too big for text davinci03 but with with gpt4 we have 8 000 tokens and then with 3.5 16k we have 16 000 tokens so we could actually probably do more but the thing is is that again 3.5 turbo is actually you know what let's try it real quick heck with it heck with it while we're here let's go back over to chat let's give it this chunk because if it can if I can do it faster and cheaper why not why not um and then we need this is our system message we need to make sure that we're going to use 3.5 turbo 16k so that it's got enough space okay turn the temperature down we do not want you to be creative thank you very much um all right and then let's see how well it summarizes it um yeah so it's not this summarization is not nearly as elegant or as concise um but just glancing at it it's okay I think I'm gonna stick with with four but I'm glad I did this side by side so the the the gpt4 it's a much more elegant summary and it's also less wordy even though so it's not quite as fast and it's not quite as cheap because we need to capture the essence of something that's really important let's use the smarter model uh now that being said again 3.5 turbo uh the the June 13th one plenty plenty good for a lot of things Okay cool so I'm glad I ran that test where are we what am I doing I don't know I'm lost I'm always lost there's this meme it's like a pug in a field with a wizard hat and it says the the the meme is like not all who wander are lost except Dave is lost as and that's me I am the pug with a wizard hat does that make any sense I need more coffee oh okay all right I hope you find this entertaining because I just woke up and I was like my brain's like hey we should work on this all right now we're back here all right we've got our chunks so now what we need to do so this is this is where it gets fun so uh four Chunk in chunks this is super straightforward uh let's see um messages equals uh this is going to be a list and then the um roll will be whoops user and the content wow I know how to type I promise it's just getting it from my head to the to the hands on the keyboard to the screen that's too many steps right now content equals chunk okay cool so basically what we're doing right here is we're setting it up to look exactly like this so I'm I'm putting the Chunk in here and then we also need to load the system message so what we're going to do is we're going to do um system equals open file uh system underscore summarize so this is this is the instructions um dot text so system message is the new prompt engineering um all right cool so then we'll do uh roll system and content is system all right so now we're ready to pass it up to our model right here so then we'll just do response equals chat bot messages ta-da as that simple um so it's ready and so this response is going to be the summary and so now I need to figure out how I want to save this save these summaries out in a way that makes sense um let's see let me ask my chatbot assistant okay cool great uh now I want to pass a list of strings to a function and have that function save them to a specified folder as a parameter and I want it to serialize those files like so um so it'll be like file001 dot text file zero zero zero two dot text and so on um let's see you should see the script I'm working on all right cool so then we're gonna we're gonna have um summaries equals list and then summaries dot append response so now basically we're gonna have the summaries all in order and what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy and paste this into my scratch Pad so that the chat bot knows what I'm working on and I'll show you how that it says oh okay cool I probably should have told it that I'm going to do that with the summaries it's usually pretty good at making the inference okay cool um let's see def save strings if OS path exists or if it doesn't exist make it otherwise enumerate strings so as long as I've been using python I'm not entirely sure how enumerate Works maybe I should ask all right but let's go over here let's go back to my script save strings cool um file I 05 interesting yeah see I'm not even sure how that works fantastic let's see if it let's see if it works though um the function first checks that the specified folder exists excellent then it uses it to make it then then iterates over the list of strings using enumerate which provides both the index and the value oh okay so that's what enumerate does the index is used to generate the file name with I colon 05 in the F string ensuring that the index is zero padded to five digits well that was easy cool um right and then it uses the right method uh yeah so instead um I want I was hoping it would use my save file but that's fine um so let's go to here and we're gonna do summaries and so instead we're going to assume that that is already there and then we are going to do file path equals um OS path join folder yeah that works and then we are going to do save file because this so my save file function um encodes it in utf-8 so just reuse something rather than do it here because you see this doesn't do it in utf-8 you want to make sure that you have a nice standardized thing that's what I'm doing here file path and S so that should be good fine all right so save strings um so then we do save strings uh we'll do summaries no I need to do yes summaries and then summaries and that should work uh now that being said I want to print the response as I get them um there we go and then response all right let's give this a whirl and see if it works CD what is this EU AI Act let's zoom in a little bit python stepo one so this will probably take a while because we've got three thousand line 3 300 lines there we go cool hmm hold on oh right right right forgot about this okay so this is an important thing um what I started doing and I forgot to integrate this so what I started doing is I when I whenever I called a chat bot I return the text and the token use um so because this is actually really helpful if you just go ahead and return the tokens so that you know when to summarize it so instead what I need to do is response tokens um because I don't need to save I don't need to save a tuple out here but this otherwise looks good and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to go grab uh something to make the the printout look a little bit better um reflective journaling tool this one has this one has good pretty output so we're going to do formatted lines yep so take the formatted lines here and then we'll do rent do I knew my new line and formatted lines all right so that will that'll make it that'll make it prettier and then we'll also use um so this this is this is why I appreciate when people um uh add feedback is we added uh someone added the Halo which is a little like thing that shows that it's thinking so I'm going to add that real quick as well and the way that you use that is down here and so once once this is running I'll pause the video so you don't have to watch the whole thing so you're actually probably closer to the end if I had to guess oops spinner start so we'll say summarizing next chunk and then spinner stop okay so let's try this make sure it works summarizing next chunk hey look now it gives us some output better user experience it tells me what it's doing uh text wrap is not defined whoops what do you mean I need to import everything that you use import text wrap let's try that again third time's a charm all right and if this works then I'll go ahead and pause it and then we'll come back once the whole video is or once the whole thing is done uh why is it in hold on hold on that's not right why are you giving me this garbage that's not correct oh right I need to print out formatted text my bad don't give me this nonsense because basically what you want to do is you want to have it formatted in such a way there we go see so now we have this nice little Block it's easier to read um all right cool so this is working we'll watch it just a couple times you see how fast it is uh the the June 13th update is much much faster um let's see excellent excellent excellent so we will I'm gonna pause the video and we'll come back and uh and take a look at the final result cheers okay and we're back so after uh running it all here let me just show you what the results were we've got 37 files um each with a summary and I wrote a really quick I hacked together a really quick script that uh merged them all and so the merged result is thirty four thousand uh characters long so we reduced it by a factor of ten to one uh just just shy of ten to one which when you plug that in over here that's six thousand tokens so we went from from sixty thousand or seventy thousand tokens I don't remember exactly to six thousand tokens one of the reasons that we had a more drastic reduction of token count is because we removed all the serial numbers and stuff because that's kind of Superfluous if you if you remove symbols and stuff like this these are high token uh things if it's ordinary words like Ai and each system these are easy for the model to tokenize so that means what we can do now is we can just take this whole thing and come over to chat and say um let's see uh uh main purpose uh here darn it believe that you are a uh chat bot tasked with uh discussing uh the following uh legislation with the user uh make sure to well hell that I mean that's all it is uh use the legislation summary below to conduct the conversation and that's it and so then we say uh legislation summary and we'll copy paste it here and so then we move over to we could do 16k because that'll be that'll be faster um actually here let's try that real quick let's try that temperature there okay um give me a high level overview of this uh legislation after five years um how is it funded foreign let's see the funding and the implementation of this legislation comes from the multi-annual financial framework uh blah blah blah blah the financial impact includes allocation of resources um and having watch that go through how many um employees will it cost there we go 10 full-time equivalent employees all right so we can clear that out uh just because it ultimately is Superfluous so some of the questions um uh let's see will this legislation hamper research and innovation let's see the legislation aims to balance the benefits of AI research and Innovation with the need for safety and respect for fundamental rights it includes measures to support Innovation such as AI regulatory sandboxes and reducing the regulatory burden on smes and startups so that smes are going to be subject matter experts like you and I as well as startups the goal is to provide legal certainty and prevent Market fragmentation which can actually Foster Innovation by creating a Level Playing Field for AI developers however it imposes certain requirements and obligations on high-risk AI um how does this legislation Define higher risk AI uh let's see the this legislation categorizes AI systems into three risk levels unacceptable high and low or minimal high risk AI is based on their intended purpose and usage while the specific criteria may vary high risk AI generally include those use the safety components of products covered by Union harmonization legislation as well as AI used in critical infrastructure management education vocational training employment and workers management these high-risk AI systems are subject to requirements um what are unacceptable types the legislation prohibits certain AI practices that are considered unacceptable due to their potential to violate fundamental rights while the specific types may vary some examples include manipulate human behavior exploit vulnerabilities or enable social scoring by public authorities right so as I mentioned uh social credit system these practices are deemed harmful Freedom dignity democracy quality and fundamental rights okay cool does this legislation address existential risk at all um does it address autonomous AI the legislation does not explicitly address existential risk or autonomous AI systems wow okay now one thing that I will say is that if you look at the legislation it does talk about like basically human supervision um yeah so like AI regulatory sandbox by one or more member stages no like here um it where was it it talked about not supervision of the sandboxes but like AI systems basically need to be steerable it's in there somewhere um okay but let's see it does not specifically address a potential risk associated with highly autonomous or super intelligent AI systems that could pose existential threats however the legislation's emphasis on risk management human oversight oh that's what it was oversight not supervision and robustness requirements for high-risk AI systems indirectly contributes to addressing the safety concerns associated with AI Technologies it is important to note that addressing existential risks related to AI may require further research discussions on potentially additional regular regulations in the future okay cool so there you have it this file is saved as merged.txt um let me go ahead and send that up to git so you can all use it uh let's see get status get add get commit am all done get push all right so there you have it you have a uh a much much condensed version of of the EU act here and merged you can plug it into the playground and ask questions to your heart's content if you have access to it but otherwise you can at least just read it here um yeah I think we're all done thanks for watching
