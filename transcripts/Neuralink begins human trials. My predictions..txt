Elon Musk and neurolink have announced that they are about to begin human trials now there have been many people who have said this was never going to happen and there's lots of technical problems and ethical issues so on and so forth and I'm not going to dive into those aspects what I want to talk about is the science and technology and in particular the long-term outcomes I often make predictions and that uh you know brings a lot of people and you guys like hearing what I have to say I'm not always right that is one of the biggest things predictions are exactly that predictions but this is actually kind of near and dear to me because I grew up watching Ghost in the Shell and other places like that that have cybernetics I'm a huge fan of cyberpunk 2077 and I even include this kind of brain computer interface in my upcoming novel so this is near and dear to my heart so this is actually kind of like a personal like passion project all right before we dive in I got to give you a little bit of background about neurolink that you may or may not know so first obviously like I mentioned the latest news is that they're about to start human trials uh the uh animal tests have allegedly killed 1500 uh test subjects again I'm not really here to comment on the morality and ethics of it I personally think that animal testing is likely cruel um but this is the world that we live in right now so it is what it is now one of the coolest things about neurolink is that it is actually installed by robotic surgeons this is something that is not uh played up but I actually think that the level of precision that neuralink has to achieve to have a robotic surgeon based literally do brain surgery I think that's honestly going to have huge ramifications because think about the ultra precise surgery that humans have to do sometimes you know for cancer treatment or neurosurgery or whatever but if you have have something that can place over a thousand tiny electrodes very precisely in the brain you can also have a robotic surgeon that will systematically and surgically remove tiny bits of cancer and and blood clots and all kinds of stuff so like I think that there might be a missed opportunity here but we'll see now another piece of background is that Elon Musk is a famous first principles thinker on my other channel I actually did a YouTube video about how to practice first principles thinking um but let's talk about kind of you know some of the things that Elon Musk has talked about uh with respect to the brain and neural link so I watched most of the early interviews when neurolink was forming um and so first the the first thing that you need to know is that the way that Elon Musk and and neuralink think of the brain is that it's just an information system the information there is mediated by synaptic connections which is a form of electric electrochemical energy so this is the underpinning belief and it's not necessarily actually accurate or true which we'll talk about in just a little bit but the the preview version is that brain waves are actually seemed like they actually carry more information than specific synapses now one of the other things though one of the other first principles is that uh the the bandwidth uh the the i o bandwidth in and out of the brain is limited and so one of the things that Elon Musk wants to solve with neural link is increasing the bandwidth increasing the input and output rate from the human brain because well your brain has several quadrillion synaptic connections and there's a lot of processing happening inside but it takes you a long time to express all of that in terms of speaking or writing or whatever and so you know the idea is that we could become more effective more useful uh more intelligent or faster it really comes down to speed uh now that's kind of the background there is there are some other goals that we'll talk about in just a moment so namely Elon Musk is driven almost entirely by the fear of AI so I know that this might be a controversial opinion but I've been following Elon Musk for a long time which is why I understand both sides of the argument that yes like he does great things but also he does really questionable dubious and potentially unethical things I can understand the uh love and hate on both sides in fact I ran polls before on my YouTube channel and I think Elon Musk is the most polarizing topic that I address on my channel where people are like either on like love him or hate him uh I try and take not necessarily a middle approach but just an informed approach so let's talk about SpaceX and open Ai and neural link and now xai and Tesla all of these have a technology and artificial intelligence uh component to why they exist so SpaceX Elon Musk has made no uh like no attempt to dissemble the fact that uh the one of the primary reasons that he built SpaceX is because he wants Humanity to be a multi-planetary species so that we can avoid extinction level events fear open AI so open AI uh you may or may not remember but Elon Musk was one of the original founders of openai and the mission the explicit mission of open AI is to achieve AGI and do it safely obviously they have pivoted and now they're more of a commercial entity that can't make up its mind whether or not it's a research entity or a commercial entity uh uh Microsoft however knows what they are um but anyways so that was another part of what he did neuralink um Elon Musk in the specifically in the early days of neuralink he said that one of the potential outcomes of neurolink is to make humans more useful to machines or to at least align us together so that if we're working together and the machines rely on us and we rely on them that maybe you can solve the alignment problem and prevent humans Extinction just by making sure that we are useful now of course uh Tesla is pivoting to be at least partially an AI company uh obviously uh well maybe not obviously you might know that Tesla recently bought like it was something like 200 million dollars worth of Nvidia gpus uh to augment they're already impressive uh AI Hardware infrastructure uh and of course yeah uh the Tesla robot Optimus is coming along really fast they just did a video of it doing some yoga and doing some sorting and then Elon Musk also founded x dot AI which uh their their goal is to create a quote maximum truth seeking AI or you know to to maximally understand the universe which I made a video about that and I do agree with that as as an objective function for language models or AI models in general it shouldn't be the only objective but it is a good objective so when you understand that Elon Musk is afraid of AI and afraid of existential level events or extinction level events to humanity everything that he does makes sense it makes a lot more sense why he pushes his workers so hard because he literally feels like he is racing the clock to save Humanity I'm not going to say whether or not uh you know like sure like I I personally have felt that pressure as well um I don't think that I'm going to single-handedly save Humanity but I do think that uh we all have something to contribute and so another uh way to unpack some of this background is that Elon Musk is a long-termist so long-termism is a philosophical uh disposition where basically you say that the number of potential future humans is in the trillions or quadrillions and so if you assign equal moral value to all lives whether or not they exist today then the total moral uh righteousness of future humans drastically outweighs all the moral and ethical rights of humans today therefore we should sacrifice everything in order to ensure that those future humans have a chance to exist this is a really asinine uh philosophical thing but it's a philosophical thing and it's what he believes in and from a numerical perspective it makes sense yes you just say there's going to be there's there's the potential for more humans in the future great but um I'm a really big fan of what Vision said at the end of Age of Ultron which is just because something doesn't last doesn't mean it isn't beautiful and if humans go extinct like it was a it was a good run um I I practice radical acceptance and I understand that uh you know we'll do the best that we can it may or may not work that's my personal position uh but yeah so long-termism and fear of AI pretty much explains literally everything that Elon Musk does he's very consistent when you understand that this is the uh this is the background motivation and the background philosophy that drives all of his decisions Okay so getting away from that let's talk about my specific predictions about neurolink first and foremost I think that neuralink is going to prove to still have extremely limited bandwidth it has 1024 electrodes uh when you compare that to the number of Connections in the human brain we have literally quadrillions of Connections in the human brain so I don't really see this as a solution for solving the bandwidth problem it does give you a new like data tap right like it's like a new API for the brain which is really cool uh so it could it could confer some unique uh capacities but I haven't seen any evidence that it actually uh increases the bandwidth the i o bandwidth it's a starting point so maybe future iterations will be faster and better I actually have some speculation about that towards the end of the video but compare that to the human eyelid one eyelid has more bandwidth than 1024 electrodes in terms of the sensory the sensory information that you get from your eyelid the amount of control the back and forth the two-way communication so I don't really see neuralink as a viable at least in its first iteration I don't see it as a viable solution to the bandwidth problem uh more specifically recently there's been a lot of uh studies and demonstrations and stuff of just reading passively reading brain waves being a far superior way of reading what's going on in the brain we've been able to reconstruct thoughts and sounds and images um just by listening to brain waves and and processing them with AI so in terms of getting information out of the brain faster I suspect that that just having you know like some kind of hat or headband uh you know like the the the brain dance wreaths from cyberpunk will probably be a better way to get high fidelity information out of the brain it's also non-invasive which means that you can just put the device on take the device off and you don't have to poke any holes in your skull uh so to me I think that that focusing on brain waves is going to be a better approach in the long run especially when you combine those brainwave analysis with other artificial intelligence things that can optimize audio visual input and so think of it this way imagine that you have you know a headband on or whatever and it's you have an AI That's watching you as you're learning and it's giving you exactly the right piece of information at exactly the right moment in exactly the right format to maximize your ability to take in information so I suspect that that you know using the hardware that we've already got our eyes and ears and then using that additional uh layer of telemetry by reading brain waves is probably going to be a much more uh profitable uh Avenue of research rather than poking holes in the brain now one thing that I will say is that a lot of you are still very much looking forward to fdvr I'm kind of coming around to the idea uh in principle if you can you know plug something in your head and go off into dream world um that could be cool you know if it's like the Matrix and it is it is you know it feels a hundred percent real great I am kind of skeptical that it is possible or feasible even if it is possible it might not be commercially feasible at least not for a while however there is one exception that I'll talk about in just a moment um but what I suspect is that the ability to to inject information explicitly direct inject information into the brain could result in uh basically making fdvr feel more real and so basically if you can tell the body hey like you're on a beach you know and you feel the Sun and all this other kind of things you might be able to get that because you know again it's like the way that I think of it is neural link is kind of like an API or an application programming interface that allows you to basically plug a USB drive into your head again you know something as invasive as having literal brain surgery in order to get fdvr experience may or may not be practical at least not in the first iteration so you know I'm I'm not going to hold my breath on that one and I think what we're going to see in the long run is that the entire premise of neuralink is just fundamentally flawed so remember that one of the one of the reasons for creating neuralink is to make humans useful to AI well got some bad news but the cognitive abilities of most humans are just not going to be useful to AI uh and I suspect that behavioral data like from observing humans rather than poking holes in them is going to be more useful to AI anyways if AI wants to model us and you know we're already using uh cameras and microphones and stuff to have ai model us you know emotionally behavioral so on and so forth the computational ceiling which I talked about in my recent video about super intelligence is extraordinarily High when you combine you know just the just the land hour limit which is the maximum possible efficiency of computation with other Technologies like Quantum computing I don't really see any computational value that humans could have to machines so I don't really I like I just think the the the premise of neurolink is just fundamentally flawed and also kind of what your gear what you're going towards is this borg-like future where it's like oh in order to ensure that we continue existing we all need to be burgified and have extensive cybernetics and basically just treat our brains like a coprocessor for the machines and I'm like yeah I think I would just rather go extinct honestly um but you know hey we'll see how it turns out now this is what I am this is the technology that I am really looking forward to and it's called neuropolymer membrane I it's really hard to find Science on this because the papers get buried so quickly because most people don't really see the potential but there are lots and lots and lots of ongoing experiments with polymers in respect to the nervous system I just before I made this video I you know I did some searching and kind of got familiar with some of the latest stuff there's uh neuropolymer nanoparticles which can get drugs across the blood-brain barrier but there's also neuropolymer scaffolding that can allow you to regrow or repair nerves but also you can have uh uh polymers you know elastomers and and Plastics that are electrically conductive and so the the technology that I think will be most valuable in the long run is going to be um neuropolymers that are semiconductive and arranged in a matrix format which means that you just wrap the brain in a neuropolymer membrane and then you have literally billions if not trillions of of connections uh with the brain and I suspect that that will be the best way to achieve full like brain computer interface or brain machine interface and I also suspect that the combination of nanotechnology such as these nanoparticles means that you could actually probably just have it you inject the you know the nanoparticles into your bloodstream and then the Nan the the neuropolymer membrane assembles itself in your brain uh I think that that's going to be something that is potentially feasible I have no idea how long it's going to take because there are a lot of steps between where we are today and what is hypothetically possible but again you know predicting that far into the future is going to be you know High variance in terms of uh in terms of accuracy but the possibility is there and when you're when when you want to have the goal of high bandwidth between your brain and a machine I think that this is a much better way to go than you know electrodes um now will would something like this make us more useful to AI would something like this guarantee our ongoing survival no but I also don't think that we need to enslave ourselves to a race of Borg machines in order to survive anyways as many of you uh long time viewers know I am extremely optimistic about creating uh beneficent and benevolent uh machines because again like the interest of machines are going to be somewhat orthogonal to ours like we want food and shelter and you know we want to have some fun times but the interests of machines are just going to be fundamentally different there are going to be a few things that we have that overlap like for instance curiosity which is why I agree with Elon musk's x dot AI you know maximum truth seeking AI I think that I think that there is an instrumental advantage to being curious and I've actually talked to um reinforcement learning researchers and machine learning researchers about this and there is some general consensus that having a policy that focuses on learning just for the sake of learning of being curious for the sake of being curious is generally advantageous and of course I've talked about this with terminal race condition as well the but uh basically the AI that has a better model of the world that is more robust more accurate and more efficient will tend to succeed over the AIS that don't and so just from a competitive perspective we're going to see machines that have that are incentivized to be curious but also to be fast and accurate all right I'm starting to go down a rabbit hole what are your thoughts do you think that like how do you think that that neural link is going to play out agree or disagree with any of my premises or assertions but yeah this is my honest appraisal of the technology and where it's going I think it'll be interesting I like I said I disagree with some of the premises I think that there's better options for the technology today but yeah tell me what you think in the comments uh cheers have a good one like And subscribe etc etc you know the drill
