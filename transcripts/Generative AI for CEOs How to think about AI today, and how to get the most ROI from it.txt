good morning everybody David Shapiro here with another video so today's video is going to be a little bit less about the narratives around Ai and that sort of stuff and it's going to be a little bit more uh down to Basics uh let's talk let's talk business with artificial intelligence uh particularly generative AI uh real quick plug before we get started uh I am available for one-on-one consultations on patreon and I'm also available uh for for different kinds of engagements uh reach out to me on LinkedIn if you'd like to talk about any of the things that I'm talking about here all right so getting right into the show let's talk about generative AI for CEOs and we're going to look at it at a very high level so first we're going to look at it through the lens of people processes and tools uh all organizations go through Transformations and one of the ways to look at organizational transitions is through people processes and tools what kinds of people do you need and how does that how does that change what kind of expertise training that sort of stuff how do your processes change uh within the business and then what tools do you use so this is just kind of the the the background framing we're not going to unpack these in any particular order we're just going to kind of talk about generative AI through this particular lens so one thing that you can think about generative AI is that it's just more software at a fundamental level generative AI is just a new kind of software but it is still just software one thing to keep in mind is that uh technology you know computers uh software that sort of stuff has automated and accelerated business for decades this is nothing new it's nothing different this is just the next flavor for those of you in the technology space you might remember how virtualization was a very disruptive technology for the data center and that ultimately led to uh the the preeminence of cloud computing which is now pretty much standard and so the combination of virtualization and apis and stuff that made cloud computing uh you know the viable business model that it is today this is no different from how Oracle and SQL Technologies transformed uh the way that businesses handled data and then of course there's everything that Microsoft did for for business productivity from their office suite to Microsoft Windows and everything else team Foundation everything so from that perspective from a software perspective you can think of a generative AI in two primary categories the first category is that generative AI is a new kind of automation and so you know again business automation nothing new uh and business automation is also it doesn't really change the idea is that you just do more with less you do it faster and you do it more reliably so looking at generative AI through the lens of automation the idea is that it can take some of the workload off of humans and put it onto machines and then it can allow you to get more done faster with less and more reliably that is the entire point of automation another thing that you can look at it is and this is kind of the fundamentally new aspect is it has to do with decision enhancement and what I mean by that is that the particularly language models they can Aid with all kinds of things whether it's judgment creativity appraisal brainstorming drafting they can also read a tremendous amount in very short periods of time which can allow you to make better decisions by ingesting more data than ever before so by thinking of generative Ai and these two uh like I guess categories Automation and decision enhancement that can really help you target where in your corporation where in your organization to look at using generative AI again the idea of automation is that you get more done faster and of course time is money another thing is that you can do it with less you might be able to do it with less head count or you can take the ideally you take the head count that you do have because we don't want to see anyone get laid off if we can avoid it and then you you Empower your existing staff to do twice as much four times as much 10 times as much so that is and then of course you can also use generative AI to perform checks and interlocks which can raise the quality of work and make it more consistent so those are a few uh kind of off the cuff ways to think about it like yes generative AI is just more software but there's it does give us a couple new capabilities of this software So speaking of new capabilities uh generative AI mostly right now is text and images but there's other modalities coming soon namely video audio and a few other things so what are the what are the Baseline capabilities that this technology has first of all as a language model it is primarily based on text which means it can read everything it can ingest email chat papers scientific papers articles laws protocols reports logs tribal knowledge in the form of KB articles documentation that sort of stuff so when you think when you have a machine that can read at a thousand times faster than any human think of the text Heavy aspects of your business whether that is combing through financial reports or consolidating Knowledge from from chat logs customer feedback there's all kinds of stuff that is text based or could easily be rendered as text that you can then just read and get a tremendous amount of information from now the problem there of course is you have to be asking the right questions and there are also still technical limits namely the window size of some of these things you can summarize and transform text and information and so what I mean by that is you can take a large block of text and you can either make it smaller or change the formatting or that sort of thing which again this is one of the two one of the new tools in the toolbox that allows you to engage with the data that you do have in a different manner uh brainstorming and planning so this is one of the most powerful aspects of tools such as chat gbt it's like hey I'm addressing this problem help me brainstorm how to approach it uh I've used brainstorming everything for uh writing fiction you know it's like hey I'm working on this scene uh help me brainstorm a few ways to approach the scene so that it you know ticks these boxes right you give it you give it some constraints and Technologies like chat GPT will absolutely surprise you in terms of what they're capable of helping you brainstorm because they it has a lot more information than than you will ever have and so if you give it the right constraints and the right problem space it will surprise you and it'll add information to uh what you're trying to do planning one of the things that's really good at is helping you think through every step of a plan brainstorming and planning are among the most cognitively demanding tasks and we'll talk about cognitive demands and cognitive offload in just a moment but basically you know there are some things that chat GPT and similar Technologies can do that can save you a tremendous amount of mental energy which then you can allocate to other things other problems that AI is not yet capable of doing and then finally Drafting and revising uh you know whether you're writing a legal document or an agreement or a contract or even just drafting an email I mean I use chat GPD it's like hey I need to respond to this email I want to do it diplomatically and explain it clearly and you know like yes I am good at writing but it's just easier to have the machine write the first draft for me and then I can clean it up and then revisions as well in some of my previous videos you might have seen where I use uh the chat GPT API to provide feedback on my fiction and and plenty of other things I often use chat GPT for uh helping actually even make these slide decks although I'm getting better at making these slide decks so I actually need it less which is a really interesting phenomenon it's like okay I've actually gained new skills by using this tool and I am better at communicating now and I need this tool less really fascinating I don't know if that's going to keep up but anyway so here these are four basic categories of new capabilities that you can think of in terms of okay what is it that generative AI is actually capable of right now and then from there these are kind of the low level building blocks that you can slot into other products other services whether it's internal or external right because you might have internal facing tools you might have external facing tools and these are things that you can just kind of pipe into existing Frameworks existing processes to make them better you can also think about these when creating new products and services okay so as I promised cognitive offload most humans are capable of two to maybe four hours of high performance cognitive labor per day many people less so an average a rule of thumb is about two hours so the idea of cognitive offload is that it's like okay whatever it is that's difficult you uh delegate that to someone else you delegate it to a machine excuse me you delegate it to a machine you uh you do something to make it easier you create a process or you offshore it or whatever so what are some things that are cognitively demanding decision making there's a phenomenon called decision fatigue if you follow hbr uh and or scitec daily or whatever there's plenty of research that goes into decision fatigue and basically what this means is that the cognitive demand of making decisions all day is very very taxing it's very draining and so what happens is that after making too many decisions once decision fatigue takes over people will just kind of go with the default answer or whatever they're most comfortable with or they'll use simpler and simpler heuristics and objectively speaking decisions get worse with with time and fatigue so any place that you can use generative AI to offload some of the decision-making process from humans or to augment it right because it doesn't necessarily mean taking it from Human but instead instead of having to have a human synthesize all the things and think through it you can have the AI generator report like okay based on the problem space that you're addressing here's the top three choices you know think through this and again this is something that I use chat GPT for all the time it's like okay help me think through what you know what are the questions that I'm forgetting to ask myself that sort of thing and by by having the machine do some of the thinking for me it preserves my cognitive energy for other problems speaking of problem solving problem solving is also very very cognitively demanding whether you're trying to solve a financial problem a legal problem a technology problem having something that you can bounce ideas off of or ideally actually just pipe it into your existing products and services and platforms where either it can solve the problem for you or it can help you solve problems again this is going to be a high value ad where the overall intelligence of your organization will go up if you use generative AI to help your organization solve problems better but it also save your employees brain power for the problems that AI is not yet capable of solving learning learning is something that uh All Humans Do it's natural it's instinctive it's reflective sorry reflexive you don't even need to think about doing it but when you put yourself in a position where you're deliberately learning and stretching your mind that is very exhausting it's very taxing uh and so what you can do is you can use these tools to help streamline your training your learning and what that does is that you uh can meet everyone where they are for your training programs and you can also often learn faster because then you have an interactive modality and you can basically create an internal uh customized tutor that says okay here's the company's training material let's get through it and then instead of just like watching a brain dead boring video that nobody actually cares about anyways you can have an interactive experience which one will make the training more engaging uh and that that level of Engagement means that people will enjoy it more and they'll retain it better and then of course that's you know corporate training is one thing but there's also there's also the uh acquisition of new skills so let's say you're bringing you're onboarding a new product or a new service or you're shipping a new product and service and you need to teach people about it so remember that learning is very cognitively demanding and AI chat Bots are already good at tutoring and teaching and so this again is a way where you can use the AI not to replace humans but to augment humans and bring them to the next level creativity synthesizing new ideas is also very very difficult it's very cognitively demanding and while Technologies like chat GPT and others are not technically creating anything new most humans don't create anything new anyways we just remix stuff that we've experienced which is not any different from what generative AI does and also within the context of business you don't necessarily need to create anything entirely 100 new what you do need to do is take the things that you know and then deploy them with with good application you need to find the right solution for the problem that you're facing whether it's a marketing problem legal Finance HR right if you need to come up with a creative solution for an HR issue again chat GPT knows enough about the human condition and emotions and all this other stuff to help you think through and come up with Creative Solutions uh whatever it is that you're doing and then finally planning as I mentioned planning is very cognitively demanding and this is this includes forecasting anticipation or even predicting the future and so basically one thing that you can do is you can ask chat gbt say like hey uh you know the these are the business trends that I'm seeing this is what the Market's doing help me think through this and it it's not necessarily going to be 100 right but that's not the point what I'm saying is you're not using it to replace your ability to plan you're using it to augment your ability to plan so the golden rule for all of this one of the best ways you can use generative AI this Golden Rule is preserve human cognition for when you really need it so this design principle goes uh it one it's it's relatively old this is one of the chief design principles in the Unix operating system which treats human cognition as a scarce resource but also this is how jet fighters work so the avionics research industry uh for particularly for military realized that you needed to treat a pilot's cognitive attention as the scare as a very scarce resource and so the avionics in jet fighters only gets their attention when they absolutely need it and so if you watch the top gun Maverick movie um one of the scenes where the plane is like spiraling towards the ground and it the alarm starts where it's like you know pull up pull up pull you know and then as the uh as the level of danger Rises the alarm changes right and so that change in tone uh what that does is it calls the Pilot's attention to something that is at that they need to pay attention to immediately uh and so that is an example of how uh attention engineering can be used for good rather than the way that it's used in social media and this is just an example but if you the the whole point here is that the the point of cognitive offload is to treat your employees brain power those those two hours of high performance cognitive labor as a very scarce resource so that instead of you know using their raw brain power to do the work manually instead they use a machine to offload as much of that as possible so that then they can protect their productivity for or elsewhere so here's some questions to ask so these are based on questions that I often ask when I'm Consulting uh and this is these are the questions that I ask to zoom into and find okay where is it that you need to use generative Ai and how do you employ it so the first question what activities are the most menial tedious and time consuming what do you avoid doing because it's just too painful so this is a really good question I usually start with something like this especially if if uh you know my client or whatever doesn't really know what they need or know how to deploy generative AI it's like okay what are your pain points and of course this is a business practice that is as old as business itself what are your pain points let's see if we can address those pain points with generative AI and you know the the way that it can address it is you know look at cognitive offload and new capabilities the second question is what activities actually add value what is the objectively uh beneficial business output of a given activity or in other words what is the value proposition what is what is the activity that you're doing that is actually giving something to your customers what are you getting paid to do what is the outcome that they're looking for because if you apply generative AI directly to your outputs to the things that bring in Revenue obviously that's good for business what a lot of startups are doing right now is trying to invent new products and new services to create entirely new revenue streams but there's plenty of existing businesses out there that could probably help their Top Line you know get the get the net uh income up by providing more goods and services either at a cheaper price or adding some novel features to their products and services but by by actually paying attention to the objective business value of any activity and this it doesn't necessarily have to be the business outputs it could be the outputs of a given Department the HR department your legal department your it Department your marketing department right because one of the what is the output of the marketing department you generate you generate leads which can lead to revenue so that's what I mean by outputs what is the objective value added number three how do you know that an activity is successful whether it's a kpi intuition experience what is it that you actually pay attention to to know that you have been successful the reason that this is a good question for generative AI is because sometimes it's not obvious how generative AI can help you be more successful so if they're like you know if you're looking for an intangible right like maybe you need to build customer trust or build rapport that is something that uh that might surprise you but chat GPT and other similar Technologies can actually help you with you say like uh hey I you know I'm gonna I've got a customer that I'm cultivating um let me feed you in the profile for this customer let's talk about this customer and let's connect with what they actually need right how can I how can I make this customer trust me how can I earn their trust right and so that's just one example of where if it's a marketing a sales sales team it can generative AI can help them increase their level of success if you pay attention to what it is that actually makes them successful and it does not necessarily have to be something that you can put a number on in fact a lot of business is something that is very difficult to measure objectively now that being said chat GPT doesn't necessarily need metrics this is one of the biggest differences between conventional machine learning and artificial intelligence and generative AI it operates in qualitative space not quantitative space this is the biggest fundamental difference between data science in the past and data science today is that pivot from quantitative data numbers forecast linear regression that sort of thing to qualitative information what is it that this person likes and why and how do you earn their trust and finally question number four what activities are the highest priority or highest stakes in other words where would having an extra brain or an extra set of eyes make the most difference so this is something where uh often if something is high priority or high stakes that is where that's like the sweet spot right that is that is the meat and potatoes of your business because that is the that is the set of tasks that only humans can do right now and they are they're going to be the bottleneck right so what I mean by that is uh I used to work at managed service providers and so you know one of the biggest things was uptime if the if the data center goes down or a service goes down that's money out the door so that means that's a very high priority task and so if I were Consulting for a managed service provider and they said Dave how can we use generative AI to help our bottom line I said what are the what are the biggest uh priorities that you have and it's like well if we have a severity one let's you know we need to all hands on deck and one thing this is just from my experience in technology one thing is that a lot of people are very reactive I actually had to leave a job because my boss did not understand the value of eliminating technical debt and so he's just like oh well we have fire alarms on a daily basis and that's just the way things are and I said no the hell it isn't like prevention is what we should be doing right if if your fire department is over taxed because everything is burning down maybe you need new fire code he didn't get that so I left that job but my point is is that there there are going to be key risks and key business activities that are responsible for a good chunk of the money coming in and the money going out so that's what I mean by high priority and high stakes you pay attention to those things first and you fix them as much as you can by adding generative AI uh to make you know to to change those ratios so they got more coming in and less going out uh you know you can ask and as a CEO you can ask these questions of every department head you can also look at it from an internal perspective or an external perspective how do you engage with your customer your vendors your clients how do you engage with your internal stakeholders how do you engage with your uh your financial stakeholders your shareholders these are you can generative AI can apply to literally every level of business okay so on the tool side so we talked about the people in the processes let's talk about the tools uh first one thing that you can do the best one of the approaches is that you can create drop-in tools so one thing is that a lot of people get wrong is they're trying is they try and build tools that require a fundamentally different workflow and it's a fundamentally different approach to business and I this is something that I often talk about with uh for startups where they're like oh we've got this great new tool that we're building it's you know based on generative Ai and I'm like okay great but how are businesses going to use it is this gonna is is this gonna require them to adopt an entirely new workflow is it going to replace existing tools or ideally it's a drop-in tool that just goes in alongside every other tool in their toolbox so for instance in the marketing department they already use file servers they already use Photoshop they use Adobe and and image services stock image services so in that case image generators like stable diffusion and mid-journey and adobe's Firefly these are all drop-in tools where they fit into the existing workflows perfectly and so when you're whether you're looking at adopting a generative AI tool or service make sure that it will fit into your existing workflows because that's where you're going to get the most value out of it if it's a tool that requires a fundamentally different approach the the path to adoption is just that much harder and I you know I saw this on the back in my it infrastructure days all the time where it's like yeah there's a great new powerful tool but like we can't really use it because it doesn't integrate with anything else that we do and it's going to fundamentally change the way we do business which just means it's not a good fit and this is this is something for startup CEOs to keep in mind it's also something for CEOs that are not Tech Centric or AI Centric when adopting AI tools make sure that you make sure that you get those drop-in tools one another thing to keep in mind is that general purpose tools like chat GPT are often the hardest to use because you have to know a lot about the tool you have to know a lot about what it is that you're trying to do and you have to interact with it in a very fundamentally different way than you've ever interacted with any uh technology tool in the past so because of that part of what makes a a drop-in tool is going to be the affordances and user experience design that says oh this is just like this other piece of software that I use this other app that I use all the time it just has some AI baked into it and it's really easy to use this is one of the things that I consulted with in the early days was there was a lot of people just putting together generic dashboards of AI tools and I'm like you have no coherent strategy there's nothing about this that just stands out and says Ah I know exactly what this tool is for and you know so basically what you're trying to optimize for is make your generative AI tool as intuitive as possible where you can just pick someone off the street put them in front of the app and they say oh I know I one I know exactly what this does and I know exactly how to use it just by guessing if you can if you can do that then you uh almost certainly have a drop in tool now the other thing that you can do is you can improve existing systems so this could be you know if you've got teams if you've got slack if you've got exchange you know or or even log services or whatever and of course that's just all looking at it from the I.T side there's plenty of other business platforms whether it's your financial workflows your marketing workflows whether if you if you if you're not trying to add a new tool what you can do is if you have access to the code base uh for you know your internally developed tools you can add generative AI uh for at some of these uh decision points in order to make it just a little bit better a little bit faster so the primary example I have in my head is servicenow and other um internal management things like that so let's say you have ticket routing you've got uh follow-ups you've got emails so basically like you know instead of having uh humans do a lot of the work you can have the machine do a lot of the work for the humans and to say hey which one of these emails do you want to send to this customer as a follow-up uh or if there's a if there's a ticketing system you can have the ticketing system ask a few obvious questions before a human even looks at it so that there's by the time your ticket gets escalated to an actual engineer or whoever it gets to a few questions have already been asked immediately and so there's more context which can reduce your mttx another place that you can look at it is human intervention where in uh and it can either be routing to the correct human so I was actually just talking to a friend about this on the medical side uh who's at a startup trying to use generative AI which is uh if there's a if there's a patient need how do you write it to the route it to the correct medical provider that is a that is a great use case because you can feed a whole patient chart into the llm and say what what exactly competency what competencies does this person need right now um and then you get the you get the exact right thing and then you make sure that uh that that uh you know nurse or or specialist also gets the exact notes that they need uh without having to go talk to a you know a bunch of other people because I mean heck one of my one of my patreons several of my patreon supporters are in the medical field and they talk about just how annoying it is when charts aren't updated correctly and when uh Physicians and nurses don't talk to each other or they you know forget to pass something on so again you can reduce human interaction uh or sorry you can reduce the need for human intervention by having some of these interactions automated and then finally cognitive offload if you if you go hunting across your organization for the things that are really demanding those are ways that you can improve existing systems because you know you reduce the frustration that will increase productivity increase satisfaction and that also just all speaks to the bottom line okay so that was people processes and tools let's talk about better faster and cheaper otherwise uh how do you get the best return on investment from any generative AI initiative whether it's a product or service that you're thinking about adopting or one that you're building uh internally so the the primary three questions here that you should ask yourself is uh what can generative AI do better than humans what can it do faster than humans and what can it do cheaper than humans and so this is what I mean where it's like okay if you can offset some of the labor costs uh you can ideally hopefully you preserve your existing head count but you take your organization to the next level and you can double triple quadruple productivity while also doing cognitive offload so your your human employees are happier so this is a universal truth of technology technology has always been a force multiplier so you know the the Industrial Revolution example that I always love to give is the tractor tractors are very complicated they're expensive heavy pieces of equipment but we still use them because they have the physical power output of literally hundreds of horses uh and so you get rid of the you instead of feeding and providing veterinary care for hundreds of horses you have a tractor that all it does is drink gasoline need some oil and some replacement parts every now and then generative AI is a cognitive Force multiplier so let me say that again the the first industrial or the first three industrial revolutions were more about uh communication Force multiplication and physical Force multiplication generative AI is the first example of a cognitive Force multiplier it doesn't just send email faster right because you know email came around in the 80s or whatever which is like okay cool communication now happens faster that's not really cognitive labor or crunching numbers right math definitely very cognitively demanding but this is a new era of of cognitive labor force multiplication so that's why this video has cognitive offload as a central lesson as something to look for when you're trying to integrate generative AI into your business better so uh keep your ear to the ground but you know basically chat GPT has already demonstrated Superior uh clinical judgment than many doctors and this is according to Harvard research it also has better uh executive judgment executive reasoning uh than many people and this includes managers and some CEOs and so in this case look for the activities where generative AI is demonstrably superior to humans this will give you obviously a competitive Advantage but if it is better than you use the machine right humans can go use a rake and a hoe and and and and and plow uh the field but we don't have humans doing it by hand anymore because the machine is better so just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should especially if the machine is better than you at it now again this doesn't necessarily mean get handed over to the machine entirely but you should be using the machine to augment your abilities so in the case of doctors if there is any room for doubt maybe doctors should be required or maybe not required but you know as part of the the medical resourcing system like you know epic and Cerner and stuff you integrate some uh some language model technology into that where it's like okay cool uh based on this patient's chart and test results have you thought of X Y and Z uh just enough just enough to clue in that the physician on the direction that maybe they need to go in order to augment human judgment and augment human executive reasoning now one thing about this is that unless you have a you know a product or service where they've done the work and they can say look this this AI service that we've built is demonstrably better than humans you're going to need to figure that out for yourself through experimentation and consultation um and also as I mentioned earlier you will need to start measuring some things qualitatively rather than quantitatively so if if the objective is patient satisfaction or customer satisfaction or trust or any number of those other intangible things they can be a lot harder to measure but fortunately language models can help you measure those things through approximations and so what I mean by that is just ask chat GPT um you know how can I measure customer satisfaction or trust or whatever and it'll give you some cool ideas about how you can measure that and then you say well what's the difference between quantitative and qualitative trust me if you do that experiment you'll see what I'm talking about uh but again this is no different from using machines to do things that humans either couldn't or shouldn't do uh you know a forklift right yes a human could you know unpack a pallet and put everything in the you know on a new palette in the truck but it's easier to just use the forklift to pick up the pallet as a whole and put it in the truck for you likewise there's going to be some things that generative AI it can just do that a human can't um or that would take a human way too long to do so just offload those things and let the machine do it because it's already better than the human faster so generative AI is super super fast it can read literally like 20 pages of text in a few seconds no human is capable of that and then it can use that text it can either summarize it brainstorm extend it it can draft a new version all of this happens really really fast and of course time is money right velocity is speed plus Direction so you got to make sure you're going in the right direction but basically so this is another thing that I do when I'm Consulting is I say what takes the longest you know so when I consult with scientists and academics it's like oh well you know writing grants is takes forever um you know Grant proposals Grant reviews that takes forever or writing research papers and revising research papers takes a long time whatever business activities take the longest those might be good targets uh for generative AI uh not related to generative AI but many many years ago earlier in my it infrastructure days I was working at a small uh medical startup medical software startup and I I we got a couple new servers and I added these new servers to their build Network and so then their software builds took went from 26 hours to two and they said well Dave you threw off our entire workflow because instead of kicking off a build and then just coming back the next day we just go to lunch and come back and now we have to keep working but again if you can I mean and Technology can do this you can shorten things by a factor of 10x or 100x I usually look at the things that can happen that we can shorten by 100x say okay what takes the longest here we've got some lawyer friends right the you know there's there's a bunch of active lawsuits out there and I said okay given that we have generative AI that can read and summarize you know hundreds of pages of legal documents really fast how can I build a tool that is going to really help you get to the bottom of these things really quick uh so again looking looking at ways that generative AI can speed up really basic stuff just reading right don't underestimate the power of speeding up really basic tasks uh so another example is that I have I I've built my own tools that I use for uh for helping revise my writing um Chad GPT still sucks at writing by the way um but so I don't use it for writing I use it for revisions and providing feedback because that's something that is really good at it says Hey I just read this whole chapter let me give you some feedback on it and it gives really good feedback I know because I've paid a professional editor and it gives me uh feedback at a very similar level as a professional editor now that being said it does miss a lot of stuff but instead of a two month turnaround I get a 30 minute turnaround so that's what I mean by look for things that you can accelerate by a factor of 10x or 100x so let's see going from two months or 60 days to 30 minutes that's you know 60x and then instead of hours it's minutes like so I mean you're looking at a 200x speed up by using chat GPT API for getting uh feedback rather than using a human so again like you know those that level of speed up is absolutely possible with generative AI look for those and you're going to really make a a very good difference in some departments and then finally cheaper uh here's the thing is that a lot of stuff costs a lot and human labor is one of the most expensive parts of of uh many businesses and the best expense is no expense so what I mean by that is unfortunately we are seeing where like many many companies are doing huge huge layoffs as they pivot and I don't know if those jobs are ever coming back but that kind of goes outside of the scope of this video but what I mean by that is that if there is something that you can do cheaper with AI than paying a human or you can Empower a human to do some to do the same task faster and therefore cheaper that is kind of the direction to look at so where can you lower costs with generative AI this one is actually a lot harder to do because uh again it's it's better at some things and it's certainly faster at some things uh but you still need human oversight you still need human uh you know guess and check or whatever uh you need experts supervising these systems um but with that being said there are ways that you can probably lower costs because again chat gbt has a 20 a month assistant it can do the work of literally like thousands of dollars worth of cognitive labor for you per month um so that you don't need to hire like a research assistant or that sort of thing which then frees up the you know cognitive labor of other humans but again look at where it's cheaper uh generative AI in the form of image generators much much cheaper than graphic artists which is really really unfortunate for the graphics artists out there and I don't have a solution but from a business perspective this says like okay hey we can get a lot more art done uh much faster and much cheaper uh than than with the humans you still often need humans to do touch-ups and and that sort of thing and to even Drive the machines but again much cheaper because it is faster you can also use it to do a SWOT analyzes and that sort of thing again that goes back to the cognitive reasoning where you can use generative AI to help look at and control those outflows and then so this is uh we're closing in on the end of the video one thing that I really want to point out particularly for the for the managers middle managers and the executives watching is that you need to be using generative AI to augment yourself um whether this is using tools like chat GPT to develop your sense of empathy and to be more diplomatic uh to even be more vulnerable to learn to be more vulnerable with your customers your employees uh your star players that sort of thing you use that and you will develop better relationships and and you'll develop more trust and have a lot more of that intangible benefit of working with your employees and but employees inside the company and then customers outside the company introspection so this is one of the most unsung things that all leaders need to do is using these tools whether it's chat GPT or the reflective journaling tool that I built or anything else understanding how your own mind works and What Makes You tick is absolutely critical to being a good leader because if you're doing things for the wrong reason you need to be aware of that so that you can fix that and make sure that you're doing things for the right reason introspection and the way that generative AI can help with that is really really good and then finally smarter if you're not using generative AI to learn more faster to make sure that you have good understanding you will be left behind and so this is something like I know I'm saying that like really bluntly but the fact of the matter is if you're not using generative AI to make yourself smarter to make smarter decisions your competition is so it's that simple and then lastly ethics and courage I've mentioned a few times during this video that in some cases I think generative AI will inevitably lead to layoffs job loss and that sort of thing uh there's going to be really tough decisions ahead for a lot of people and the competition May undercut you and you might feel like you have to compromise your principles and your values in order to stay competitive the thing is it's a foregone conclusion that technology will will disrupt markets do you remember borders borders imploded because of Amazon that's just the name of the game so if you need to close the doors and pivot maybe that's what you need to do and it really sucks because nobody wants to go out of business nobody wants to lay off you know hundreds or thousands of employees because you're going out of business that being said it's probably going to happen now even if you don't go out of business layoffs and pivots are coming they're actively happening um you know like you remember telephone operators telephone industry didn't go away telephone operators did and so going through these pivots is going to be very difficult and and very painful for some people so what I want to leave you with is this idea that there are three guiding principles that you should probably keep in mind as you Embrace generative Ai and that is Trust dignity and respect so first make decisions that prioritize earning and keeping trust once trust is lost it is very difficult to get back and if you look at some of the technology or tech companies out there that have abused the markets trust abuse their customer trust by violating privacy and that sort of stuff I gotta tell you like I'm never going back to those platforms I don't know I don't care what they do and so if you sell your trust if you if you sell your trustworthiness in the age of generative AI you will probably not be able to get that back because Above All Else a lot of people are are caring more and more about privacy and not being abused and manipulated uh by the corporations that we engage with if you watch my my channel you know that I am very very skeptical of corporations that being said I also understand that corporations are here for a reason and they provide uh critical goods and services to all of us so make sure that you put trust front and center with the way that you deploy and use uh generative Ai and the decisions that you make a strategic decisions you make around generative AI dignity so this is something that is one of those more intangible things which is you know how do you prioritize human dignity this means um this means treating people with respect respecting the Dignity of their time off respecting the Dignity of their competence Their Fear so this is another thing A lot of people are absolutely Paralyzed by fear because they don't know what's coming and as a CEO you might not know what's coming either but if you treat people with dignity and you say you know what I'm not going to compromise on this value then they're gonna like you more they're gonna they're gonna give you more of the benefit of the doubt and and trust you to see it through and then finally respect respect for human rights respect for privacy respect for the way that people feel if you prioritize respect as well as trust and dignity then you know even if your company implodes or even if you have to lay off people you're not gonna you're you're you won't regret it put it that way you will not ever regret prioritizing trust dignity and respect no matter what else happens and so with this my my caution to all Executives and leaders out there in the age of generative AI is do not compromise your ethics and principles but also be courageous and make some bold decisions because if you're not making bold decisions other people will so for a quick recap we talked about the people processes and Tools around generative AI this is you know generative AI is just like any other software it provides new capabilities new opportunities but also new threats one of the key ways to look at generative AI is look at where it's better faster and or cheaper than humans this is where you're going to get the most bang for your buck when you're either building your own generative AI tools or you're buying or procuring generative AI goods and services uh and then second to last with self-improvement as an executive leader if you're not using generative AI to improve yourself somebody else is namely your competition and you're gonna get left behind and then lastly the slide that we just did was ethics and courage which means whatever happens whatever's coming if you if you compromise your ethics you might regret it but if you don't compromise your ethics you will not regret it so choose the path of least regret this is um actually a mantra that I live by is what decision will I regret least in the long run and then be courageous about it because again this is a bold time with a tremendous amount of opportunity but uh you know fortune favors the Bold so thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this thank you very much and uh again reach out on LinkedIn or patreon and let's talk if you want to if you want to talk about any of these topics cheers
