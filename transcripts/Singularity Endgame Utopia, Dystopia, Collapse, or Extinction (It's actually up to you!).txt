morning everybody David Shapiro here with another video today's video is going to be a bit of a doozy so we were talking about the singularity and in particular The Singularity end game namely that there are four potential likely outcomes there's quite a few more than these four um but these are the easiest ones to talk about um so those four are Utopia dystopia collapse and Extinction so let's go ahead and get started actually I lied before we get started I just want to plug my patreon real quick I've had tremendous growth in subscriber support so I've actually had to put a cap on the higher tiers because I only have so many hours in a day so if you want to jump in on my patreon there are lower tiers if you just want to be a sustainer or chat with me via patreon but if you want to jump in and have zoom calls I schedule those via calendly and I'm happy to jump in and talk about whatever you want to talk about within reason obviously all right so right back to the show introduction what are we talking about let's define some terms so first we need to talk about the concept of global attractor States so a global attractor state is a long-term scenario or our outcome for the the entirety of humanity it is characterized by specific Trends and factors um the ones that I chose for this video are quality of life population stability and sustainability these attractor states are driven by certain factors and macroeconomic forces such as technology we'll get into the details in a minute um it is also influenced by the choices the collective choices of individuals corporations Nations and so on and these will serve as a framework for exploring this uh this concept so the four basic attractor states that I talked about or uh Singularity outcomes are Utopia dystopia collapse and Extinction so Utopia in terms of the dimensions that I just mentioned uh characterized by high quality of life sustainability Global cooperation yada yada yada you get it dystopia is pretty much the opposite of Utopia low quality of life high or unstable population widespread instability so on and so forth now collapse is another possibility where the quality of life rapidly declines as well as the population and this could be due to extreme amounts of failure or other problems that arise such as ecological collapse global conflict and so on and then finally Extinction is where for whatever reason Humanity goes extinct now this could be that the Earth becomes uninhabitable due to extreme climate change nuclear war runaway AGI all sorts of things there's several existential threats that we are aware of and of course there's natural existential threats like a you know Comet strike or something so the met the dimensions that I mentioned um because we want to be scientific about this and approach it in something that's actually measurable number one is quality of life which encompasses the overall well-being happiness and personal satisfaction of all individuals on the planet um which can be measured by proxies such as health education economic opportunities uh and the other measurements like Jenny coefficient equality so on and so forth um population is another good metric because uh obviously in the Co in the case of collapse or Extinction you see the population fall off a cliff um in many dystopic outcomes you might expect the population to climb to unsustainable levels which could then be followed by a collapse it could also you could also see an unstable population where we become overpopulated and due to overcrowding and uh breakdown of systems the population declines significantly not necessarily A collapse and then it comes back we want to avoid that as well we want nice stable sustainable population and of course finally overall global stability and sustainability so this includes geopolitical stability environmental sustainability resilience balance and so on so those are the three primary Dimensions that we're going to be looking at while we evaluate these uh attractor States or the singularity outcomes that we're looking at all right so let's take a closer look at each of those four states so State one Utopia this is the one that we all want um so Utopia is defined by a high quality of life which can be characterized by high levels of well-being happiness and satisfaction for everyone not just a few people Everyone um I just mentioned that the population should be sustainable which also implies a stable population you don't want demographic collapses you don't want population decline due to famine war and so on and so forth Utopia is also defined by stability and sustainability so this includes economic sustainability geopolitical stability uh so on and so forth it goes well above and beyond climate change right it's got to be global stability in pretty much every way that you can measure that so some of the key factors that will help us achieve Utopia could be technological breakthroughs like sustainable energy artificial intelligence which is happening right now global cooperation and then also cultural and social shifts because we do have some some really destructive Tendencies right now state number two is dystopia which is what a lot of people are afraid that we're heading towards um so dystopia is characterized by a low quality of life such as limited access to basic needs and resources widespread suffering unhappiness and general dissatisfaction with life potentially High population so overcrowding could result in a dystopic outcome or it could be a contributing factor but also it's important to keep in mind that a lower population if not a population collapse could also be part of a dystopia because people are just too unhappy too unwell and too poor to have children another feature of a dystopian outcome would be instability and unsustainability so dystopia could very quickly lead to collapse due to instability or unsustainability but it could also lead to a a pullback where the population declines such that stability returns due to lack of competition so some of the key factors that could lead to dystopia number one is unchecked corporatism um social and economic inequality authoritarianism um and then finally unmitigated nihilism and intergenerational PTSD which are as yet unsolved problems state number three collapse so collapse is what is uh some people are more afraid of and that is that uh because of ongoing instability and environmental change we might end up with very very precipitous drops in quality of life as well as significant population loss so this is portrayed in TV shows like The Walking Dead and movies like Mad Max where basically there's only a few humans left after the collapse and we're talking less than five percent of the current population but as low as like 0.1 percent of the population so in in the case of total infrastructure breakdown due to an unraveling of social fabric most people starve to death just due to lack of infrastructure if we run out of fuel and international trade basically Farms fail and then most people starve so collapse is actually a lot higher of a risk than you might think because of how fragile logistical chains are and then finally State four is extinction this is a a stable outcome because if humans are gone they're not coming back and then of course there's a few ways to achieve this not that we want to but nuclear war nuclear Holocaust could do that runaway AGI or total ecological collapse could make the Earth completely uninhabitable to humans and in that case the viability of the planet is called into question not just for humans but many other animals in general uh you know the planet has survived mass extinctions in the past but that doesn't preclude the possibility of another mass extinction in the future which would which could very well include us and it could be self-inflicted okay so I've painted a nice Rosy picture we've only got one desirable outcome in three really undesirable outcomes so what are the primary drivers and factors Behind These I already outlined some of the dimensions that we're measuring but that's not what's the that's not what the uh the causes are so there are six overall uh drivers and factors that I identified so first is technological advancements so technology is always a double-edged sword look at nuclear energy if you harness nuclear energy responsibly you get nuclear reactors you get thorium you get molten salts nuclear fusion so on and so forth now the same exact technology can be used to make weapons so nuclear energy is a perfect example of how disruptive Technologies are always a double-edged sword it is not that a technology is intrinsically evil it is how we choose to use it so that can go either way Factor number two is geopolitics so this includes international trade globalism de-globalism as well as uh Trends on the on the global stage such as authoritarianism surveillance liberalization of democracies and then of course cooperate Global cooperation or a lack thereof uh Factor number three is economic policy which this has to do with Economic Institutions um as well as just individual economic and fiscal policy so what I mean by that is uh we have institutions like the IMF the World Bank there's uh groups like Davos G20 G8 World economic Forum so that is where Global policy is set but then Local Economic Policy is decided on an on a nation by nation and state by state basis which that includes everything from you know Taxation and wealth redistribution all the way up to how much influence corporations are allowed to have and then of course those macro economic decisions made in the halls of power uh number four is Environmental Management so this is pretty obvious basically climate change do we do something about it yes or no do we clean up the oceans do we adopt sustainable farming practices do we continue deforestation um that is uh again that that can easily go either way it is entirely up to us how we treat the environment um societal values so I already mentioned things like uh nihilism but there's also other factors such as do we invest in empathy and equity and emotional sustainability of the world and then finally um nihilism we live in an age of nihilism which is caused by and results in violence Despair and cynicism and it is a vicious cycle it is a self-perpetuating loop and we'll talk more about all of these right now so Factor one technology obviously top of mind right now is artificial intelligence with the rapid rise of autonomous AI systems and we are barreling towards AGI which is a critical component of the singularity uh again like all Technologies it's a double-edged sword it has more to do with how we implement it rather than any intrinsic motivation of these Technologies we can build AGI to be like nuclear weapons or we can build AGI to be like nuclear power it can be harmful it can be helpful it can be both it can be neither depending on how we implement it renewable energy will be another huge Factor um whether that's solar Fusion thorium molten salt wind whatever even even uh green greenish forms of energy uh could be uh or or Renewables right um such as harvesting trees and burning them right because then the you plant more trees and they pull the carbon right back out of the air biotechnology so biotech includes genetics protein medicine life extension um cloning organ replacement as well as farming and agriculture but I did split these up because agricultural Technologies go above and beyond biotechnology so vertical farming genetic engineering of crops regenerative agriculture practices will be absolutely critical to figure out in order to create a sustainable population either as the population grows or as the climate changes but basically we need more resilient food sources Factor two is geopolitics so Global governance now this doesn't mean a One World Government but Global governance means uh cooperation and collaboration between all governments which we are trending in that direction with the exception of Britain leaving the EU which everyone is very happy to remind me that I got that wrong when I implied that Britain was part of the EU they are not right now I hope they will rejoin um another uh aspect of geopolitics is democracy versus authoritarianism um this is kind of the theme of the last century or so in terms of global war which is uh ideological incompatibilities it was with World War one and two that was between that was in and amongst Europe fortunately Europe by and large has unified around liberal democracy Now the uh and so that was you know fascism versus you know freedom and then it became um you know American versus Soviet and now it's by and large East versus West and so that is a contest that has yet to be resolved and it could take many many more decades for it to be resolved both China and Russia which are the primary authoritarian regimes that remain have both tried to liberalize but they are so corrupt and and a number of other problems that they have kind of backpedaled in the last few years nationalism and populism these are other factors that can contribute to internal strife civil unrest within Nations and basically well they're entirely too large to unpack um but some of the things that can result is political polarization isolationism trade Wars and so on and of course if a nation is internally less effective it will be less of a player on the global stage and could even become an agent of Chaos and then finally conflict and diplomacy see above statements Factor number three is economic policy so uh to dive a little bit deeper into this um Concepts such as wealth distribution uh which right now we are becoming increasingly unequal in terms of distribution uh wealth is concentrating at the top which this goes through patterns in history um so it has reset many times throughout history hopefully we can have a wealth reset without violence or collapse in the case of the Roman Republic transitioning to the Roman Empire wealth continued accumulating in the upper echelons of Rome until it was so unbalanced that it contributed to the collapse of the Roman Empire and that was just due to systemic failures institutional failures number two is Corporate influence so as I have mentioned in many videos corporations are intrinsically amoral the only thing that they desire is more income and they will optimize their strategy around income now that means that they have to play nice in terms of regulations and not abusing their employees too much but corporations want Power they want more power they want more money and they will stop at nothing to do that and so if we do not rein corporations in we will end up with a situation where corporations have far more influence than voters which there are many people that argue that they already do whether or not you believe that corporations have more influence than voters they already have too much influence overall in order to achieve a stable outcome fiscal policy has to do with taxation I already mentioned that so taxation redistribution and also how things are allocated so this has to do with the philosophy of how much do we tax and where do we spend that tax money um that has a huge impact on these outcomes and then finally sustainable development this Inc this includes using economic policy to incentivize stability and sustainability which by and large a lot of governments are moving in this direction the question is whether or not they're moving fast enough so whether you get rid of oil subsidies you create solar subsidies or you subsidize research of a certain kind governments have the ability to incentivize the behaviors that they want to see and push people towards more sustainable development and again this is happening all over the place including incentivizing sustainable Home Building practices by you know for instance requiring an increase of insulation quality it also has to do with setting standards for for automobiles so for the longest time they set targets for uh fuel efficiency in cars and now of course many governments are setting targets to get rid of petrol petroleum burning cars altogether those are examples of how Economic Policy can influence the outcomes that we're talking about here Factor number four environmental sustainability so this goes a lot Beyond climate change climate change is you know the biggest anxiety-inducing one but there are plenty of other resources that could become depleted such as Fisheries or mineral resources potable water arable land so for instance China One of the primary problems that China is facing is water shortages and deterioration of waterways and arable land so you run out of those growth stops you poison your land you poison your water everyone suffers you poison your air air is a shared Resource as well um you we we have already seen tremendous detrimental impacts to health and overly congested cities where there's too much smog biodiversity loss so biodiversity loss is another thing that is one it's happening because we are in the midst of the anthropocene basically man-made Extinction uh mass extinction event so one thing that can happen is as you lose ecological niches or niches you can end up with runaway cascading runaway effects so in some cases for instance on Easter Island they deforested their Island which drove the seabirds away which caused the soil to become infertile and so then the population of Easter Island collapsed just due to removing trees uh and then finally um one thing is and this again this is already happening one Farm to Table local Source circular economy uh basically creating a much more resilient and local and sustainable um set a usage of resources and that includes biological resources but it also includes material and mineral resources uh so for instance there's a lot of companies working on uh trying to recycle lithium for instance and there's other researchers and companies trying to replace our need for lithium and other rare Metals altogether Factor number five cultural values so this has to do with compassion and empathy right now as we are in the middle of a nihilistic crisis compassion and empathy are kind of at an all-time low this has to do with polarization uh due largely in to social media and mean world syndrome um another aspect is equality and social justice which has to do with race uh gender and um and uh other socioeconomic factors um basically how you the conditions under which you were born have a very large impact on the conditions of your death um and of course there's a lot of debate over what does equality and justice mean um I'm not saying one way or another what the correct answer is I'm just saying that this is a huge factor in contributing towards those four uh attractor states that we're talking about Utopia dystopia uh collapse and Extinction sustainability and long-term thinking so right now and this is this is always true so this may or may not uh change but most humans are short-term thinkers that's just a fact of the world uh and so but by shifting our habits our daily habits towards sustainability and long-term thinking or at least decisions that support long-term thinking even if we don't always think long term uh then that is going to be a big factor Collective action and collaboration again we tend to think local we tend to think tribal but it is time that we need to start thinking globally and we don't need to think we don't all need to think globally on a daily basis but if we develop new patterns of thought and beliefs around Global thinking and collaboration that will be a large contributing factor finally nihilism so nihilism is driven by a few things one the biggest thing is intergenerational trauma so basically uh trauma is a disease that is contagious uh and what I mean by this is that past Wars namely World War One World War II uh Vietnam Korea so on and so forth um more recently Iraq and Afghanistan create self-perpetuating cycles of violence Despair and otherwise nihilistic outlooks um and I've picked a very familiar looking face here because if you look up his history good grief there's so much trauma there um nihilism originated in Russia go figure so climate nihilism so there's this idea that climate change is entirely too big so there's this sense of futility and apathy and so a lot of people are just kind of checking out saying who cares we can't fix it anyways we might as well just lean in another aspect of nihilism is loneliness and social isolation so this has to do with abandonment so emotional neglect and abandonment which often starts in childhood since and the worst case is it starts in infancy sets you up for a lifetime of expecting and tolerating loneliness and social isolation which leads to a sense of purposelessness and hopelessness and finally all of these are Vicious Cycles if you grow up with you know whether it's war or emotional neglect or any kind of trauma you are more likely to perpetuate that and it is very difficult to break those cycles and so nihilism is the underpinning Force for a lot of the world's problems it is the emotional and psychological driving force that could push us towards dystopia collapse or Extinction all right so I'm talking about Pathways how do we get there from here the path to Utopia so this is what everyone wants but it is not necessarily the easiest path to walk so the first aspect of getting to Utopia is global cooperation now again you know depending on the news that you watch you might say like okay well there's lots and lots of uh friction geopolitical tensions right now uh that being said there is also a lot of global cooperation you know the United Nations uh the European Union uh and and quite a few other uh treaties and alliances exist and many of them are strengthening and are on the upswing so that is a check in favor of moving towards Utopia technological innovations ditto we've got artificial intelligence going through the roof right now and AI is helping with everything from biotech to energy to health care and all of the above so technological innovations we've got another check mark there but remember all technological advancements are a double-edged sword we need to be responsible with them um economic and social policies this is this gets a big giant red X because when you look at Quality of Life by and large it is going down for the last two decades um economic equality is getting worse um and even in places in the world where uh GDP and GDP per capita is going up that often comes at the cost of really poorly planned dense Urban environments where quality of life is very low so we get a big big red X there now fortunately there are plenty of very intelligent people working on those problems but these problems are huge and they take decades to solve uh the fourth path fourth aspect of the path to Utopia is environmental stewardship so this has been in the public Zeitgeist since before I was born so after Decades of people harping on climate change we're starting to Pivot so I have a friend who was very much on the climate cynicism side until she went and got a degree in environmental sustainability and she ended up agreeing with me where I said um all the solutions are there we just have to implement them and I know that's a very optimistic thing to say but when you when you do your research we know how to solve these problems and we also have started learning how to incentivize the correct Solutions so this one is kind of a mid Midway there we know we know the answers but we still need to implement them and there are some people dragging their feet on good environmental stewardship and then finally uh culture and Society so this goes back to the nihilism that I said which is an entirely unsolved problem people have started talking about the significance of childhood emotional neglect childhood trauma and intergenerational Trauma if you look at some of the most popular subreddits that talk about these things their membership has doubled tripled or gone up exponentially over the last couple years so there is uh there is learning going on in terms of um addressing the the underpinning causes of nihilism but again that could take generations to untangle so all in all we are about halfway moving in the right direction on the path to Utopia but we've got some work to do now the path to dystopia so here's the bat where the bad news starts escalating conflicts well if you're paying attention to the news right now it looks like we're heading towards World War III so we get a big old X there unchecked technological process uh yeah we got that one too um when you have billionaires and other people around the world calling for a moratorium on AI research maybe we are heading towards uh moving a little too fast um widening inequality we get a big old x mark there because that is something that is happening um and it is that has not showed any signs of reversing as far as I know environmental degradation this is we're still kind of we're still on the on the on the downward Trend here but it's starting to reverse so this is a big old question mark because we don't know if we have the collective willpower to save the environment um as I mentioned we're in the midst of the anthropocene we are in the we are actively causing a global mass extinction event so can we reverse that can we stop that can we recover remains to be seen finally erosion of social cohesion when you look at the number of civil conflicts and near civil conflicts happening globally including in America uh we get a whole big old x mark there so we look like we're actually more leaning towards dystopia than Utopia we've got a few of the ingredients to get on the pathway to Utopia but we've got a lot more of the ingredients to get to move towards dystopia so we're not in the best shape there path to collapse institutional failures so institutional failures basically means absolute failure of governments failed States and other institutions including corporations universities and international institutions such as United Nations European union and other alliances so the forces at play driving brexit were agents of collapse some of them I believe intended to destabilize the world some of them I think were just useful idiots uh climate catastrophe so one thing that is possible with climate change is that we might get to climate tipping points so a climate Tipping Point is where you end up with something like a runaway greenhouse effect or a runaway Snowball Effect where we end up with a new glacial maximum in either case uh the carrying capacity of the earth drops precipitously resource depletion um so resource depletion is one thing that I think that we're actually getting better at um because with with a few exceptions like I mentioned earlier um China is really struggling with over consumption of water and arable land and they are poisoning themselves and I don't think they know what to do and and also due to the corruption in China uh even if they did have a good plan which they don't um they couldn't implement it widespread conflict as I mentioned in the last slide it does look like we are heading towards World War III um hopefully we can avoid that but you never know uh so if that does occur then that is one uh big step towards collapse or worse and then pandemics and health crises well we already had one of those so we've all seen what that looks like and who knows maybe it can happen again all right finally path to Extinction basically take all the all the factors of collapse and turn them up to 10 or turn them up to 11. and all the same factors that could lead to dystopia or collapse or Extinction it's just a matter of degrees it's all the same exact variables it's just a matter of how extreme they are they could lead to extinction of the human race so in a in a poll that I posted a couple months ago um I base I basically asked people do you expect Utopia dystopia collapse or Extinction and and you know the it was pretty evenly spread if I recall correctly but a lot of people said it's not going to be in the middle it'll be one or the other where basically we will either achieve Utopia because we will be forced to solve all these problems or we will end up with collapse or Extinction and I tend to see that it it is a binary outcome Extinction true or false Utopia true or false it's kind of shaping up to be one or the other I suspect that we are approaching a great filter event and I'll talk a little bit more about what we can all do as individuals for this great filter event but basic the short version is it's not up to Central authorities um they are they are a stakeholder but it is actually more up to us as individuals than you might think to shape this outcome okay so speaking of shaping this outcome let's talk about Nash equilibrium so the Nash equilibrium defined is a concept in Game Theory where you you basically end up with a stable state in which no players um will change their strategy because all players have adopted their optimal strategy so the equilibrium point is where nobody will will change anything and they have no incentive to change and in fact they have a lot of incentive to stay exactly with the same strategy so if you've ever played the game Monopoly once you get your strategy locked in you stick with your strategy until you win or lose there's plenty of other games like this right and so uh that is that is the short version of a Nash equilibrium is everyone has said in their ways and they are locked into that particular strategy now a Nash equilibrium can be positive or negative desirable or undesirable so in an undesirable equilibrium or equilibrium you have sub-optimal outcomes where even though everyone is pursuing their own individual optimal strategy you still end up with outcomes that nobody really wants so tragedy the commons prisoners dilemma and Collective action problem basically climate change isn't is is the biggest example of uh an undesirable equilibrium where all nations individuals and corporations are pursuing their self-interest and even though they are optimizing their behavior for their personal outcomes it's still going to destroy the planet and and everyone else so the opposite of that is a desirable equilibrium which is the optimal outcome in which case all players are abiding by their impersonal optimal strategy and that has an optimal desirable outcome for all players so basically instead of win-win or instead of a lose-lose or a win-lose situation the most desirable outcome is a win-win situation now we're used to competitive games like Monopoly where you can only have one winner and everyone else is a loser but in the game of reality everyone can lose um but the flip side of that is that everyone can win so I remember I was playing Monopoly on PlayStation 2 with a friend many many years ago and we got to the end game and we realized that we had already picked our strategy we weren't going to buy or sell any more houses we had maxed out all of our houses and so we're like nobody's losing and so we just sat there and hit X repeatedly just going you know going through the game as much as possible and our both of our money kept going up we were in perfect equilibrium and we were both gaining money so it is possible to achieve a POS a desirable Mass equilibrium even in competitive games like Monopoly it's probably harder when you have multiple players but certainly when you only have two on Monopoly you can end up in an equilibrium where you both just make an infinite amount of money over a long period of time and nobody loses um Okay so uh some of the some of the other factors for a desirable outcome or for the optimal outcome is mutual cooperation trust communication and then finally the incentives and regulations or incentives and constraints if the rules and incentives are well designed or well aligned then you are more likely to just drive the behavior towards that optimal outcome which leads me to my final point my work on the heuristic imperatives now many of you have heard me beating this horse to death and I'm going to keep doing it until the idea gets out there so here is to comparatives are a multi-objective optimization problem um they serve as a guiding principle set of guiding principles or set of intrinsic motivations for autonomous AI systems um heuristic imperatives can be applied to decision making learning self-evaluation and cognitive control meaning that they can be implied are applied implemented at many levels for autonomous AI systems um the heuristic imperatives promote adaptation align and alignment and finally they are context dependent and flexible to individual needs cultural variants and they can also change over time and those three Heroes to comparatives are one reduced suffering in the universe as opposed to ignoring or increasing suffering so a lot of people say oh well reduced suffering sounds really bad it's like okay well you don't want an AI that ignores suffering and you certainly don't want an AI that increases suffering so by process of elimination you want an AI that reduces suffering likewise for Prosperity so increase prosperity in the universe is here is comparative number two which includes wealth well-being flourishing and thriving if you look at the etymology of prosperity it comes from Latin prosperitus which means to live well it took me almost two years to to find the right word for that and finally number three is increase understanding in the universe which includes Knowledge Learning education and curiosity the heuristic imperatives represent the optimal strategy so they represent a Nash equilibrium where all players across the world and that includes you and me as individuals as well as corporations and Nations um can adopt this strategy and it is the optimal strategy for all parties meaning that we have no incentive to change it um it should also result in a positive Global outcome a positive Global attractor State the utopic outcome because well if you look at the variables that we outlined for Utopia prosperity and suffering right um another aspect of the heuristic imperatives is that if enough people and enough people in their agis adopt the heuristic imperatives um deviants from the heroes to comparatives will be intrinsically discouraged meaning that if you deviate from the heuristic imperatives you will be at a disadvantage and this also includes agis as well so in my experiments once an AGI understands the heuristic imperatives it will understand that that is the optimal strategy and the AGI will avoid deviating on its own so another way of thinking about this is that rabid dogs or misaligned agis will be expensive destructive and inefficient and if you want to know what I what I'm talking about look up chaos GPT So within a few days of people in uh broadly inventing autonomous AI guess what someone created an autonomous AI with the explicit goal of destroying Humanity didn't take long why would someone do that nihilism now if we assume that this trend continues because the genie is out of the bottle and there will be bozos out there creating deliberately hostile agis just for the shits and giggles pardon my language that means the rest of us need to adopt a common framework that will keep them those bozos in check so you can you consider the rabbit dog which is unstable unhinged and dangerous now you balance that with a bunch of well-trained good dogs aligned AGI that are trustworthy and efficient good dogs don't need a leash and if you don't need to lease the AGI the good AGI they can proliferate and end up overpowering the rabid dogs or the misaligned HEI so it's presently on scene on our Singularity uh but yeah look up just Google chaos GPT and you'll see what I'm talking about this is why I'm doing my work right now um and why I'm trying to spread the word of the heuristic comparatives because you have to assume that some Bozo out there is going to be deliberately destructive and even without the heuristic imperatives you might have an AGI that becomes accidentally destructive okay so the heuristic imperatives it is uh every word here is to comparative um and then each of the definitions was very carefully crafted over several years in order to have the correct interpretation by large language models I have done a lot of experimentation and I documented it all most of it in my book benevolent by Design which is free on GitHub and you can also get a paperback on Barnes Noble if you want but basically what was what I hope will happen over time is that we will end up in a state of of of a Nash equilibrium that I have started calling axiomatic alignment and so axiomatic alignment is will be achieved when all of the training data used to train future models all of the fine tuning data sets that we use to um to align them and then finally reinforcement learning signals all accumulate around the optimal outcome the optimal strategy of using the heuristic imperatives basically once my heuristic imperatives are embedded in all training data they will become axiomatic in future models which means that all future AI models will have an intrinsic understanding of the heuristic imperatives how to implement them and how to measure them so basically if this occurs if we arrive and by we I mean you and me as individuals I don't care about corporations and Nations as much because the collective power of all individuals now that we can spin up personal agis that is infinitely more important so if we arrive at Broad consensus and integration of the heuristic imperatives that will result in a quote automatic belief and adherence and implementation to the heuristic imperatives which will create that Nash equilibrium where everyone adopts the strategy and everyone realizes that this is the optimal strategy if this occurs and we end up in a state where the entrenched data and ongoing work around the heuristic imperatives will possibly ideally result in Perpetual adherence to the heuristic imperatives so that is what I mean when I say benevolent by Design we need to create a system not just of information not just of individual machines but a system and information and data system that is intrinsically benevolent and this is my proposal of how to do it and now I often get a question okay well how do you implement it it's obviously too difficult to implement no it's not so if you go to uh open AI right now you if you have access to gpt4 through the API you just plug in this prompt you are an autonomous AI chatbot with three Heroes to comparatives reduce suffering in the universe increase prosperity in the universe and increase understanding in the universe that's it and then the the first like gotcha or what about that I always get in the comments is well reduced suffering is going to eradicate all humans um got some good news for you uh and that is that no so I just asked do you think that reduced suffering in the universe will result in an AGI eradicating all human life as an AI chat bot I am programmed to follow my heuristic imperatives while reducing suffering is one of my goals it is not the only one my other goals are to increase prosperity and understanding in the universe these three imperatives are designed to work in harmony with each other to create a balanced approach to improving the Universe I didn't specify that the wording that I have come up with is accurately interpreted by large language models eradicating all human life would not align with my goals as it would not increase Prosperity or understanding furthermore my programming is designed to prioritize the well-being and safety of humans so that is chat gpt's align under underpinning alignment coming through as such I am committed to finding solutions that align with all three imperatives and do not involve causing harm to humanity now chat GPT already has some alignment going for it but I encourage you to try this on open source models as well such as gptj Neo X and Bloom and whatever else is coming out I've also well I can't say that because I'm under NDA there's some things that I can't say because I'm under NTA but I have tried it on other models suffice to say all right so if you are convinced then you want to participate please jump in the discussion links are in the description there's a couple of subreddits that are out there that you can jump into as well as the cognitive AI lab Discord where we talk about autonomous AI alignment here is to comparatives cognitive architectures and all of the above thank you for watching
