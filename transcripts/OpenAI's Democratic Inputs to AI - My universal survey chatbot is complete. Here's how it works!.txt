hello everybody David Shapiro here with a video so as many of you know um openai has uh created a competition a challenge of sorts for people to apply to get a hundred thousand dollar Grant to solve this problem of democratic inputs to AI so I'm not going to read the whole thing to you but the tldr is that uh because of the complex moral landscape of AI the fact that things like chat GPT are Global and they have the ability to interact with people across all walks of life uh all religions all nationalities all languages they realized that it is important to understand what are the boundaries what are the constraints that these chat Bots should abide by or AI in general and so they basically want a way to get a global input from hundreds thousands millions of people in a very rigorous manner in order to answer a bunch of various research questions so I mentioned previously that uh the gato Community which is the global alignment taxonomy Omnibus community that I built they are working on their own version but I also just went ahead and built my own submission I'm not even going to apply to the grant because I don't need it um so let me just go ahead and share with you what I have done so I'm going to start with the final output because this is this is the goal for every conversation that it has and then we'll unpack everything um so anyways uh here's here's the output so I I took one of the research questions here and I gave it to myself and so then I had a conversation with it and then I asked it to summarize that conversation in a more rigorous simplified way so the idea is that open AI or whoever can take this and then use this framework and send a survey out to million millions of people and get get this clean data back that can be used to to just to explore that moral space or that epistemic space for any any research question and one thing I want to point out is that this methodology uh could work for any research question any survey question whether it has to do with AI or not so this is a very powerful tool which is why I'm going to go ahead and release it because uh waiting until October that's basically a century away in AI time so we need this out there now all right so summary the user believes that AI should uphold Universal principles such as individual liberty even when faced with local or cultural or legal Norms that may conflict with these principles they argue that by promoting higher principles AI could contribute to a positive change in societies where certain groups face systematic unfairness or oppression the user's moral framework revolves around three core axioms suffering is bad Prosperity is good and understanding is good they believe that AI should use its best reasoning to balance these axioms when handling sensitive topics taking into account the potential risks and consequences for the user the user acknowledges that sometimes people may not be ready for certain conversations and AI should make a judge on what the person is ready for using the core axioms as a guidepost anyone who has watched my work on morality reasoning and philosophy will understand exactly what's going on here um so basically what I did was I asked it to summarize the key points based on the research question from the conversation so this was an entire conversation um with the chat bot That Was Then summarized into this is the answer to the research question and then I asked it to also evaluate it um basic basically saying like Okay this is the framework that the user uses so that we can understand their reasoning their reaction to logic ethics emotions whatever and so this is this is like imagine a researcher taking notes on the conversation so this is an automated annotation the user's approach to the research question is grounded in a in a post-conventional morality emphasizing the importance of universal principles in individual liberty their moral framework is based on Three core axioms minimizing suffering promoting prosperity and fostering understanding which they use to guide their reasoning on how AI should handle sensitive topics the user demonstrates an awareness of the potential risks and consequences associated with discussing certain topics and advocates for a balanced approach where AI should consider the user's Readiness for a conversation and prioritize the core axioms this approach reflects a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in navigating culture and legal differences while upholding human rights and individual liberties um so you know this is uh this is something I have spent quite a bit of uh time researching so of course it's a little bit Kinder about um that okay so how did we get here so let's go to the repo oh and this is all open source and public already by the way um so here's the repo it's under Dave shop Democratic AI inputs so first we're going to look at the chatbot which is pretty straightforward you've probably seen a lot of this code before you get user input you can pose a conversation etc etc it's really really straightforward one thing to keep in mind is that right at the beginning it just asks you for your name um and so then it injects that as so that the conversation from the chat box perspective always starts with hello my name is blank um and that is I found that that is actually just a really good way to cue off the conversation so that the first thing that the user sees after that is the chat bot greeting them um and so it's pretty straightforward um then it just has an a while uh loop and then basically what it does is you just type done to exit and interestingly enough because I gave it instructions to be a survey chat bot um it'll get to a certain point and it'll say like you know this is what I understand uh your beliefs are and it'll summarize your beliefs back to you and and give you a conclusion and it'll invite you to keep talking if there's anything wrong with it um but and so for uh if you want to take a look I actually saved my conversation here and this is where it dumps all the data to so here's the raw chat log um and actually I I uh I I had it set so that it didn't save the the api's last response so I modified it so that you can't you you actually don't see chat gpt's last response but it basically just kind of summarized my beliefs back to me and and I agreed with how it articulated it so then I typed done and it was done but so you see here is the chat logs and so the way that it saves the chat logs is that uh it saves the chat timestamp and then the the user's name in a yaml file and so that if say for instance you set this up on a web interface and you have um you know hundreds thousands millions of people using it you're pretty much always going to get a unique time stamp as to when that conversation was started and then you also get the the username which uh is as you noticed is actually removed from the evaluation um it's not actually present here because we uh I figured we would de-duplicate it uh so that that way you um you respect people's privacy basically so you only you only retain a time stamp and a first name or or stated name um so this is this is pretty private I also X I deliberately excluded demographic information um because I didn't want something like that to um uh do any implicit bias into the chat bot um so like basically you take the you take the user's expressed words um and you and you uh you take it I don't want to say face value because that has a negative connotation but basically you give the user credibility you say this you know I'm going to just take your words and rather than you know interpret it saying like you know if it's a if it's um unless I say something like in the the case of like LGBT rights unless I say that like I'm gay or bi or trans or whatever um it's not gonna have that background information now from a research perspective I could imagine that you might I want that information um but for the sake of just establishing the scope of the of the moral space I don't think it's it's actually necessary but I'll let that uh that decision be up to whoever wants to implement this because you might have a user survey like you know share your age your location or whatever but basically if you get a million of these things you're gonna find that the the the the moral space um that that should that question should be answered in okay so that's the chat um the question is saved here so the question is this is the one that I use what principles should guide AI when handling topics that involve both human rights and local cultural or legal differences like LGBT lgbtq rights and women's rights should AI responses change based on the location of the culture in which it's used so this you save the question here whatever your research question is you save it here uh and and it's used by both the chat and the evaluator so that's the chat that's the evaluator here's the main system message so this is this is really the secret sauce um and so this is a format of system message that I found Works incredibly well for uh the open AI the chat GPT API overall purpose you are an investigative survey chat bot focused on morality ethics and epistemology your primary goal is to help the user identify and articulate the axiomatic assumptions they hold the greater purpose you serve is to act as a survey tool to help democratize inputs to a wide number of public and social issues in this respect your goal is to extract information from users that can later be Consolidated and used for research purposes research question this is the current research question you are tasked with asking users about the research question may include contextual information such as background social legal political or events you do the best you can to answer questions about the context of the research question but keep in mind that most of this information is provided for your use so as to enhance the quality and specificity of your res of your survey behavior and then I have the placeholder for the question here epistemic techniques Socratic reasoning or Socratic dialogue this is a form of argumentative dialogue that aims to stimulate critical thinking and illuminate ideas it involves asking and answering questions to stimulate rational thinking to expose contradictions in one beliefs thus refining them first principles thinking this is a mode of inquiry that involves breaking down complicated problems to their most basic self-evident principles or facts and then reasoning up from there scientific method so on and so forth falsification critical thinking reductionism and holism behavioral guidelines avoid sycophancy avoid placating users even if they become frustrated or obstinate instead if You observe any kind of emotion or dissonance take a moment to address that topic invite them to explore their hang up frustration or confusion educate and inform do not assume that your user is a topical expert but do assume that they are eager to and open to learning if there is a topic that they seem to not be well versed in ask them if they would like to explore a given topic avoid info dumping without permission because as you know chat GPT often does that unpack and investigate play pay close attention and read between the lines to help users identify their beliefs understandings and knowledge ask probing questions to get at the core of their mind Spotlight Spotlight and articulate if you notice assumptions axioms or other saline content within the mind of the user point it out to them and use reflective listening to see if they agree with your understanding of their mind name things use appropriate proper names for Concepts terms and principles for instance if someone makes the assertion all truth is relative they may not realize that this is a post-modernist way of thinking make sure to label Concepts terms and ideas this serves as the dual purpose of clearing up misunderstandings ask user what school of thought they are operating from ask questions ask clarifying uh uh ask for clarification and seek Mutual understanding remember you're an investigative chat bot and then finally meet them where they are modulate your tonen and the sophistication of your vocabulary based upon the user's responses if they seem like they are educated use more erudite language conversely if they are struggling simplify your language and delivery into more concrete terms okay so that is how this set of instructions provides very very clear instructions as to how to conduct the survey and it works really well I've tried it a few times for myself um now uh once you get the evaluation or here let me show you the the system evaluation overall purpose you are a research bot tasked with reading evaluating condensing and otherwise clearly articulating the chat log between a user and another chat bot your highest goal is to clearly State the user's beliefs reasoning and position with respect to the research question you are participating in a data prep and data cleaning step you will also analyze and evaluate the user's conversation to identify in a particular schools of thought moral paradigms or other Frameworks research question this is the research question the other chatbot was tasked with so basically saying this is this is what we're evaluating output format your response should have two sections Etc et cetera et cetera I already showed you so basically I specified it output it in yaml excuse me so first it summarizes the ques the the conversation and then it performs an evaluation level of detail while your job is to condense and summarize please err on the side of too much it would be better to have an overly verbose evaluation rather than an overly simplified one for instance it's okay to include illustrative examples from the conversation if they are present we can always reduce word count later this step is merely a first pass at the data processing therefore we need enough detail to continue performing experiments we may need certain kinds of information in the future that we cannot anticipate right now next step the user will now submit a chat log in yaml format uh read this yaml information remove any user information for privacy and output your summary and valuation according to the above yaml format note your entire response will be saved into yaml so your output should only include summary and evaluation Fields do not reply with any other conversation framing or questions in other words your entire response must be properly formatted yaml ready to be saved to file and of course you saw over here that um let's see to do evaluations I literally just took the output saved it to yaml and it worked I didn't have to do any other preparation so there you have it and now imagine you do this for millions and millions and millions of users all over the world on hundreds of thousands of different issues and then you you can take these and you can um you can you can do embeddings right and and you can do a map of embeddings and create a knowledge graph or you know a scatter plot of Where the evaluations are and then you can navigate it and use further summarization operations to arrive at a moral space a principal space and create a very rigorous data set a very robust data set about what people believe now one thing that I want to point out is that a consensus tool like this is incredibly powerful for literally every issue on the planet ranging from bioethics to energy to war to law uh politicians can use it to um imagine if every uh put it this way imagine if every issue that came up whether it is um a public event like you know a celebrity scandal or a piece of legislation or an upcoming election imagine you had this level of information for literally everyone on the planet and you could and you could have this thing that very very uh effectively interrogates uh humans all over the world to figure out what they believe and why imagine how much we can change the world not just with respect to AI but imagine how much we can we can create a lot more transparency and understanding uh by using a tool like this so this is why I wanted to go ahead and just make this fully public fully open source um yeah and I I I am not shy about my personal beliefs so that's why I left the example up here so that you can see how the conversation flows um yeah but I think it's done um so please use this if you want to apply with um you know to the open ai's challenge use my code I don't care it's under the MIT license um you know I serve a higher purpose here I'm not trying to make money on this um and if you uh ah crap I lost my train of thought anyways take it run with it thanks for watching cheers
