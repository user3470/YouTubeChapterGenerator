hi Bae okay so um a few days ago I released videos that uh have not aged well it's fine I'm often wrong um if you remember I released a video originally that said I was super not impressed with chat GPT that was wrong I released another video saying that Google won that remains to be seen we'll see uh but the theme of today's video is about the future of search and um particularly information foraging and information strategies so uh yeah the there's mixed results um searches here forever search is toast I'm falling into the camp that searches toast so let me while this is going I will show you what I mean and we'll explore this together kind of in real time um so I've looked at how I have actually ended up using chat GPT I don't use it for homework I don't use it for writing fiction I sometimes use it to brainstorm so like you see this one like uh basically like doing doing a little bit of research oops I canceled that only one message at a time okay anyways um it'll probably finish loading So like um I did I did do a couple videos where I used chat GPT to help and I actually um I I can figure out how to get chat GPT to write fiction like basically be a co-writer but honestly it ends up taking uh just as much energy and concentration as just writing so I don't think AI tools brainstorming planning okay sure um certainly can help with like coming up with character ideas but the actual Act of writing I think is going to be a human thing for a while um that being said this is very early so we should expect it to replace it eventually um but mostly what I end up using it for is research and when I say research I don't mean like scientific research and connecting data but I mean gathering information so rather than going to Wikipedia rather than going to Google rather than looking for blogs I ask the questions here and I basically tell it here's what I'm trying to do here's the information that I have help me fill in the blanks and because this tool has semantic understanding of what it is that you're trying to achieve and you can explain it it is really good at filling in the information that you forget so like in this case I was researching um my video on my other channel um and I was talking about the Golden Age of Athens so I was like okay tell me about the Golden Age of Athens and who are the greatest thinkers because I remembered Socrates Plato Aristotle I forgot Democritus I know Hippocrates um Pericles lucidities and I was like oh yeah that's right okay cool here's a good list so rather than having you go out to Google and be like who are the greatest thinkers in the Athenian Golden Age this already has the context of it knows what I'm doing and it also kind of already has the right tone and I'm like great give me these people and then we can talk about other aspects so I can already have a very meaningful um conversation with these uh with this tool let's see if it is going to be done no I think I have to regenerate okay I'll let it finish regenerating so after taking a step back I realized that it was a um that this is mostly an information needs tool and so this comes from a library and information science which my fiance is a master's degree in and so this is where I learned it so like Librarians get this we have information needs all problems are fundamentally and foremost an information problem and so what do I mean by information needs an information problem well let's see what chat GPT says information needs refers to the information that individuals seek in order to fulfill their personal or professional goals or to satisfy their curiosity information needs can range from finding answers to specific questions to acquiring knowledge about a certain topic or event everything that we do in life is aided by information and so therefore we all have information needs whether it's how to find the right doctor that is information medicines you should take or shouldn't take that is information how to find a job how to do your job how to find friends how to be a better friend how to communicate with relationships everything that we do is an information or is is partially an information need which is why we have such big brains so information needs are Universal and that is why chat gbt and the upcoming being are so useful above and beyond Google or uh old school shirt search as well say so I'll say search so search is about okay I have an information need let me go find the document and that's basically what Google and other search engines have done is they have figured out how to search billions or trillions of documents so that you can find the document that you need that's all that the web is it's a giant decentralized document server um and so that's what search is but now we have a new way of interacting with information the goal has never been host web pages that was just the method the purpose the Imp the information Super Highway of the internet is about defining and delivering information and so large language models give us a new way a fundamentally new way of interacting with information and so rather than it just being an interface to connect you to that information it can be a repository and a brand new or a sorry I didn't say that quite right search was an interface to just connect you to the repository right but now large language models can be the repository and that is a that is a fundamental Paradigm Shift they will still like you know Bing sites at sources which is great I think that we're going to end up with in a new paradigm above and beyond that again this is all brand new this is rapidly evolving as is my understanding which is why I'm often wrong I have powerful intuition but intuition is fast and if you don't have enough information you go in the wrong direction um it is what it is so information needs that is that is the theory of it all right so now let's talk about information foraging information foraging is a term of art that comes from library and information science and the definition is it is used to describe the process of seeking and acquiring information just like an animal forages for food this term often is used in the context of information retrieval and it often refers to the way in which people search for and find information online or offline so information foraging is when you say okay I have general information needs how do I go find it and in some cases it's kind of passive such as with scrolling on social media right so one of my Chief Information foraging methods is I go to YouTube and um you know the the the stream right it's like okay the algorithm this is a recommendation system this is a type of information foraging YouTube has figured out the kinds of things that I am likely to click on nuclear-powered aircraft Finance it knows that I love the infographic show that I love saving and a bunch of other stuff flight test I love this the Wi-Fi I am a sucker for some good uh um uh conspiracy theories um and so this is this is what I mean by information forages is I don't know what I'm looking for exactly what is this I really wish I could unsee this this was a failure so they throw in random stuff every now and then that's my excuse because I generally don't click on anything with Alex Jones or Joe Rogan but there's Joe Rogan again anyways sorry getting sidetracked information foraging where do you go to look for things that you don't necessarily know what you're looking for but you have an appetite for information uh television and radio used to be a good information foraging newspapers these are all tools and methods to perform information foraging information retrieval refers to the process of locating and retrieving relevant information from a large collection of data such as a database of the internet again search engines this is a type of retrieval but with chat Bots like chat GPT information retrieval is now interactive as if you're basically talking to a librarian and that is basically what Bing does since it cites its sources information literacy this is a really critical concept so if you ever know someone who is super gullible like they just read stuff on the internet and believe it all information literacy is one of the best predictors for belief in conspiracy theories for um going into um various I won't say any specific but the cult-like corners of the internet people with low information literacy basically what this means is they're not able to discern what is a good source of information so information literacy the ability to identify locate evaluate and effectively use information it involves the development of skills and knowledge that allow individuals to navigate and make use of the information landscape so what's not in what's not specified here is what it's like to not have good information literacy and also to validate the sources so let me go ahead and ask this let's talk about information um literacy a bit more what does this um imply how does it intersect with infodemiology and so I have the benefit of I've got a lot of knowledge that I can draw on but if I didn't know how to ask this question it would be really difficult to get to what I'm looking for from chat GPT that is one big difference which is why I also study cognitive architecture because what I want to be able to do is use these large language model Technologies so that the machine will be thinking about me and building up a theory of mind or a model of me and then it will be able to anticipate my information needs that is one of the key differences between humans and large language models right now is large language models can anticipate the next few words but they cannot yet fully anticipate the information needs of someone they can with the right Framing and maybe I'll do a video on that let me know in the comments if you want a little bit more about theory of mind and anticipation of information needs I think that could be a good thing all right so let's see what it says about information literacy and infidemiology okay so it repeats the definition of literacy information literacies are essential for skills uh sorry individuals in the digital age where access to information is easier than ever before however the sheer amount of information can make it challenging to find accurate and relevant information and to critically evaluate its credibility perfect that is the Core Essence of information literacy is understanding validity relevance trustworthiness that sort of stuff information literacy and infidemiology intersect and that they both are concerned with the study of information and its impact on society infidemiology is the study of the distribution determinants and consequences of health information and misinformation in society this is because of recent world events that I won't say out loud but you get it you get the idea it seeks to understand how information particularly in the digital age affects public health and well-being infidemiology recognizes the importance of information literacy and ensuring that individuals have the skills to navigate information landscape blah blah blah okay so um uh basically vaccine reluctance as well as anti-masking is our pillars of information literacy and infidemiology okay now please speculate on the impact of llm and chat Bots like yourself on the uh changing landscape of information needs information uh literacy and information foraging for instance I am using U to replace Google search all right so I asked it to speculate so let's see what it can do it might it might uh dither and say like oh well I'm a language model so I can't but we'll see what the language model says about language models being used for this in the context of information literacy and information foraging now is it just me or has it gotten much slower since they uh allowed for um upgrading to plus I was really concerned that um that because originally it looked like that there was going to be two different levels of quality but it looks like they're not doing that it looks like you get the same model and the same quality it's just much slower if you don't pay um okay so the rise of language models like me and chatbots is having a significant impact on the changing landscape um of information needs it doesn't actually know that when it said it said this is having it doesn't it's imagining that it is um I could tell it that it isn't but it's kind of rolling with the tone information needs information literacy and information foraging here a few ways in which this is happening convenient access to information chat Bots like myself and language models provide instant and convenient access to information by simply typing a question individuals can receive a relevant answer in real time this can help individuals to quickly fulfill their information needs and make more informed decisions this was obviously um what wowed everyone about the Bing presentation was that it's like here's my information problem and not only does it give you often a good answer it will also cite its sources and then pop those up to the side saying here's my evidence for this information that I gave you um improved information retrieval language models like myself have been trained on vast amounts of text Data allowing us to provide more comprehensive and accurate answers to users questions sometimes this can make information retrieval faster and more efficient and reduce the time required to find information that that individuals need I will say yes like Google Foo does anyone remember that some of us got really good at search and rapidly zeroing in on the right information but this allows the machine to help curate that information very directly let's see enhancing information literacy literacy skills chat box like myself can help individuals to develop their information literacy literacy skills by providing guidance and support in evaluating The credibility of information for example I can provide context and information and explanations for the sources and accuracy of the information that I provide not really it's making that up um bin can unless they're unless they're doing something in the back end that I'm not aware of but it's not signing in source in theory hypothetically yes um one thing that um uh that that is implied here is that your information literacy is less important if you're interacting with an intelligent machine that it itself has some level of information literacy this is what folks like Sam Altman and Satya Nadella are talking about when they talk about safety they want to make sure there's other aspects they they put a little bit of their own morality into it but more importantly they want to make sure that the information that they're providing is accurate and verifiable but this of course opens up excuse me the entire question of uh of of uh who owns the information who gets to determine what truth is and I could do another video on that about uh epistemology um specifically beliefs evidence and consensus or lack thereof um okay so then changing information foraging Behavior chat box like myself are changing the way that individuals Forge for information I basically told it that so it's just parroting it back to me um rather than having to search through multiple websites okay so yeah um this is this this is okay um I'd like you to speculate about how things will change um in the future um speak more broadly about Society uh for instance maybe also work education politics and news um yeah let's see what it says here so uh while it's generating I'll say like okay so um this this chat here I was uh researching another video where I was talking about hunter-gatherers and um and farming and uh the uh caloric efficiency of various behaviors also see how much faster this is going it's interesting that it's so wildly inconsistent um okay and then I was researching a company that wanted to have a that wanted to call me I was researching autism I was researching wabi-sabi I was brainstorming uh chapter so this is kind of how these chat Bots are kind of settling for me obviously people use it for different things I'm not using it to make thirty thousand dollars a day like some people are claiming but it is a very useful tool let's see work in the future chat Bots and language models may play a greater role in the workplace assisting employees with tasks such as data analysis customer service and scheduling and it's kind of generic boilerplate education in the field of Education have the potential to revolutionize the way information is delivered and learned yes I am using chatbots for my own information needs um and I think that this is going to continue which means that education could really change because of this so I do agree with that politics in the realm of politics chat Bots and language models may become important tools for disseminating information and communicating with the public yes this is actually one of the potential uses of my Raven project is to be an interface between you and government whether it's local Municipal state or federal one idea is that if you have an information concierge or cognitive an autonomous cognitive agent that can be your go between between you and the government just a possibility I actually got that idea from other people um who think that that is a possibility for the future finally uh news in the future chat Bots and language models may play a significant role in the way that which uh news is delivered and consumed for instance individuals may able to use chat Bots to receive customized news feeds and so on this is actually something that we're talking about in my startup one of the things that we want to do with Raven is rather than use search Reddit or Twitter or anything else maybe you can use a chat bot or language model or my Raven architecture to just have a conversation with the news in real about the news in real time and then of course it can cite its sources and so on but um yeah okay so I think this is I think this is a good good enough place to stop I just wanted to share like okay this is how I'm actually using this tool and uh now that now that the shiny newness has worn off it's like yeah this this is a useful tool and it definitely has a place um I do a lot less Googling I didn't really notice that until other people pointed out like oh yeah I don't even use Google anymore so no wonder Google is panicking um but again I think that competition will be good um and this is an existential threat for Google uh totally so we'll see how how it plays out anyways thanks for watching hope this was helpful
