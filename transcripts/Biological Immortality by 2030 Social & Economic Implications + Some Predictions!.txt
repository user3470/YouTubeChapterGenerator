hey everyone David Shapiro here with a video so quick update I'm going to try and start releasing on every Sunday uh followed by a live stream q a they do that on the Y files and it's super lots of fun um and I did a random uh live stream q a uh just the other night and I had a lot of fun so like why not okay so anyways today's video is infinite life biological immortality by 2030. so for some background um uh Ray Kurzweil uh recently was quoted on Popular Mechanics as having said we are on track to achieve biological immortality by 2030. so there's a few component contributing factors that lead to this uh conclusion so first obviously exponential rise of AI we can solve problems science is happening faster etc etc then you get compounding returns so some of those compounding returns are things like Alpha fold mRNA vaccines and so on combined with AI then the AI is being used to make better dyes for machine learning models so on and so forth then there's nanotech so there was a recent thing on um out of Israel where uh tiny you know nanoparticle size robots were able to track and capture individual cells and then Quantum Computing so those four things are all contributing to say okay we're on an exponential ramp up uh longevity escape velocity probably has been achieved or will be very soon and for those who don't know longevity escape velocity is the idea that life extending therapies are going faster than real time so that means for every year that you age you get more than a year back in terms of medical breakthroughs so all this is to say is that we're heading towards an iPhone moment of longevity medicine or regenerative medicine and so what I mean by that is that uh new technologies tend to combine in unexpected ways which create which unlock entirely new domains and uh and markets and so on so in the case of the iPhone it had to do with miniaturization you know miniaturization of touch screens miniaturizations of compute Advanced Battery Technology and wireless internet so those three things combined to create the possibility for the iPhone and then once it exists it's like well duh of course that's the way to go so when you look at the combination of alpha fold protein science mRNA vaccines DNA printers artificial intelligence Quantum Computing Material Science all of this is almost certainly to to combine in unexpected ways and create entirely new possibilities neurolink might be like Child's Play compared to what's actually possible reality is often Stranger Than Fiction uh before we dive into the rest of the video I just want to take a quick break to say that uh today's video is sponsored by all of you my patreon supporters um and just this morning well by the time you're watching this it'll be like yesterday or whenever um a morning in the past uh I added a Discord server uh exclusive for my patreon supporters and it's already popping there's already like 150 people uh in it um it is uh really sharp people which doesn't surprise me um but great conversations over there already any patreon tier will get you access but I do have some exclusive tiers uh for higher uh higher tier patreon supporters just that way you get a little bit more kind of exclusive access and I know who to prioritize um but yeah so Jump On In if you'd like and with that back to the show so for the sake of argument let I'm not gonna I'm not gonna spend any time unpacking the problems that need to be solved because there's millions of problems that need to be solved for uh biological immortality by 2030 or indefinite lifespan as um people like Aubry degree call it but let's just assume that it happens let's assume that Rey's prediction is correct where do we go from here so I want to unpack a few ideas this is kind of how I prognosticate so let's take a look at Social reactions so how is society going to react on an individual basis are people going to accept it or reject it and if they do what does that look like number two is let's look at the economic impact is this going to help equality or or move us towards inequality number three is we're going to look at Lifestyles so you know the I I had this slide and someone asked on the live stream are we just going to be hedonists if we live forever and we can abuse our bodies or are we going to do something else so I have some ideas about that number four is innovation or stagnation so this is at a species level so one thing that people are afraid of and they've explored this in fiction is if we if we live forever we might become very risk averse and we just kind of become decadent and and self-indulgent and we kind of don't go anywhere again I got some ideas and I'll let you know uh five and six basically I'm gonna do some forecasting to see what life is going to look like in 200 years in 2000 years obviously most of my predictions well I want to say most many of my predictions are hilariously wrong but it's food for thought so let's Dive Right In so on the social reaction part um many people I suspect that many people will reject immortality for Spiritual philosophical and ethical reasons but also many people will embrace it this is assuming that it's a choice I I suspect it will be a choice I don't think anyone's going to be to have immortality inflicted on them or indefinite lifespan inflicted on them that would be deeply unethical uh but one of the key things is there's many cultures and many people have a belief that death is what gives meaning to life um my personal take is maybe this is just some self-soothing nonsense because we are trying to cope with the inevitability of death but if you have a pill that you can take or an injection that you can get that says suddenly you don't have to worry about death I think that a lot of people would take that because we're all a lot I mean pretty much everyone has a an intrinsic biological fear of death but it's inevitable and that's kind of like a that's kind of a sick joke of evolution those biological entities that are most afraid of death and work hardest to avoid it are more likely to pass on their genes but then they inevitably die anyways so that's kind of kind of kind of not cool now uh I think it's gonna split in basically two different directions so I called the first Direction the mortalitasi which I borrowed from uh from Dragon Age actually uh basically people that are that believe in death um people that maybe not obsessed with death but people that believe that mortality is good and then on the other hand are the methuselahs the people that want to live forever and that I borrowed from altered carbon so I can't take any credit for those terms I just said oh hey here's the term um so on the one hand you know when people might have made the argument oh well we were never meant to live this long anyways but nobody's really saying like well let's bring back tuberculosis right so if you can cure aging if you can cure heart disease if you can cure cancer if you if you look at these things as just diseases that are curable then it's not a matter of immortality because you we can't force someone to live rather you can still die from accidents right uh but you're not going to die from aging and age-related diseases so that's kind of the dichotomy so let's take a closer look at the social side so on the reject side on the on the on the mortalitasi side uh basically there's actually some really strong arguments to be made that aging and death are good and this is from an evolutionary perspective and I'm not going to read all of these to you um like one by one but basically whether you take it from a spiritual perspective or a scientific perspective there are some some compelling arguments to be made that maybe we are supposed to age and die uh to give way to the younger generations and so on and you know there's been bombings and riots over pro-life and and pro-choice abortion rights here in America uh you can imagine that there will probably be some uh some grumpiness over uh the rise of of biological immortality now on the accept side we also have some models from fiction um namely like the Baku from Star Trek insurrection which is a a village of people that they settled on a planet that made them Immortal and they basically formed an Eco Village before Eco Villages were cool and then the asari for Mass Effect now the asari for Mass Effect are not Immortal but they live a long time and so that's still a good exploration of okay well if you start thinking in terms of centuries in Millennia how does your life change so for those who accept biological immortality I suspect that some people are going to slow down and some people are going to speed up so on the slow downside you might say that like you're going to spend more time mastering the Arts and Sciences you might settle into comfortable routines for centuries on the speeding up side you might live Hard Play Hard right if you if you have regenerative medicine that allows you to do whatever you want you might just wander the globe um one of the biggest social changes I think though will be reproduction and family structure because think of it this way most people once they get to a certain age and they're empty nesters they kind of get lonely and bored right you know you you get a a single family home a nuclear family home and then your children grow up and they leave and then you have an empty house some couples are perfectly fine they're like oh finally the house is empty um and peace and quiet uh and some that some people will absolutely continue to live like that probably for centuries now on the other hand uh many people once they're empty nesters once they realize hey you know I've I've had my children and I don't want to have any more some people if if you're biologically 20 years old forever you might have more children I certainly expect some people are just going to be churning them out because that just seems to be what they want to do but I think other people will basically just kind of all gravitate towards um like retirement communities but since we're all going to live forever it's like retirement community okay sure so that's kind of the dichotomy there for the initial social reaction you know except versus reject now on the economic side you know the possibility of living forever uh is who this is super loaded because Here's the the big question is whether or not uh longevity medicine is cheap and accessible if longevity medicine is not cheap and accessible if it's reserved for the wealthy and the elite then we're going to end up with like God emperor of all mankind level and stuff um I don't believe that's the direction that it's going to go but I needed to address this because it is a very real possibility this was explored in the show alter of show and books altered carbon and that's where they got the term methuselahs so the meths or the methuselahs are the wealthy Elite who can afford all of the safeguards to ensure that they are Immortal now in Altered carbon not only are they biologically Immortal but they have backups and clones that they can you know transfer their Consciousness into um you know I'm not I'm not above saying maybe that's possible because when I talk about those compounding returns I don't know what's possible and I don't know what's impossible so if we have the capacity to live forever oh and so really important side note even if uh life-extending medicine is cheap and accessible for all that doesn't guarantee that we don't end up in a dystopian hell because you might still end up with concentrations of wealth and power and nobody really wants to live in a dystopian hell forever that's like the worst of Both Worlds so let's not do that okay so if we want to avoid that outcome and we want to move towards equality uh we have basically you have to assume that some people are going to want to accumulate wealth and power that's just human nature right that there there are there's a you there's absolutely always utility and having more money having more power even above and beyond what you actually need but the more money that you have the more options you have right and humans need autonomy and self-determination um so that's just you know Maslow's hierarchy of needs the more money you have the higher up on that you can get quicker so with that assumption the question then becomes how do the rest of us create and build and maintain a system that ensures that it's not too lopsided or that even if there are wealthy and powerful people they can't harm the rest of us so I'm not gonna say like you know seize the means of production however when I was having the the Q a uh the other night um people were talking about like using AI to manage resources to manage companies and so on and that's when a little like bell went off in my head and I was like wait that's what Dows are for so if you're not familiar with what a dow is it's a decentralized autonomous organization so a dow is uses blockchain technology and they're pretty much perfect for AI to run things now in the short term I don't think that Dows are going to run the whole world but I think that we're going to start seeing experiments where dowels run things like maybe homeowners associations and small companies and that sort of thing and if the technology is proven out it could be that Dows are the way that we transition to a more algorithmic kind of technocracy a good technocracy where the AI is all debate and integrate our information and our needs and then figure out the best way to manage things so that's one possibility there's plenty of other possibilities so if you and I didn't come up with this idea by the way um the first place I saw that book was a a that idea was a book called liquid rain uh r-e-i-g-n good well-researched book um the author is in English though or it doesn't speak English natively so it needed a little bit more editing but still a good good book now on the other hand if everyone is going to live forever and it's cheap then we might very well slip towards Eternal Injustice which you know we keep making grimdark movies and TV and books and video games about that so that's something that we're all afraid of so between corporate greed I said Corporal greed oops typo corporate greed and political cronyism we it could end up with technocrats that control everything and then we get stuck in a dystopian death spiral that we can never get out of and it's just and it's a cyberpunk hell but nobody really wants that except for there's a few like really cynical people who probably genuinely want that but most of us don't want that um so even even so if you saw my video about the Malik or watch Liv bori and um and Daniel schmachtenberger talking about these really mysterious forces at play that are going to push us towards that that attractor State anyways no matter what we do so we need to change the game um I have a whole other video about that so check out my Malik video my in-game video if you want to know more about how to avoid that situation but I do need to point out that longevity Medicine by no means will automatically prevent that and in fact it could push us towards that um so we need to be very careful now on the topic of Hedonism versus asceticism um you know like what do we do right if you know that you can just take a pill you can abuse your body and if you party too hard you just sleep it off for a week and then you're back to normal like are people gonna do that you know like I don't know about you but in my early 20s I was like yeah let's party um and if I had a 20 year old body again I'd probably do that again for a little while so this is this is an oversimplification but one one uh Spectrum to think about it is you can live hedonically or hedonistically or ascetically and so let's talk about the hedonic life this is the obvious kind of like you know just engage in wanting Hedonism for however long you want because you know that you'll be fine one thing that I worry about here is that if you are able to be saturated in joy and pleasure you're going to become numb to dopamine and you're going to be like constantly seeking the next biggest thing and so you know we have like digital minimalism and dopamine fasting and stuff so I think that that could be like an antidote to the hedonic life we might also come up with medicines that desensitize you or I guess maybe re-sensitize you to dopamine um but if we have like entire swaths of the population who do nothing but mindlessly pursue joy and pleasure like what's like what's the point does that maybe make life meaningless um and that'll be up to the individuals to discover I'm not going to make any judgments one way or another because even just pursuing experiences you can make a philosophical argument that that is a good thing and that longevity medicine can Empower us to have entirely new kinds of experiences so one way or another those experiences will probably be had now on the other hand there's the acidic life so acetic life is about basically living more like a monk or uh monastically where you deliberately deprive yourself of those Joys and Pleasures um and focus on developing a sense of satisfaction from uh and contentment through uh connection service reflection spiritual growth and so on and so what I want to say is that these are like extreme opposites I don't think most people are going to go to either opposite I think that most people are going to be balanced in there somewhere and so for myself in particular I usually like you know I try and have one or two like big social fun outings per week and then the rest of the time I focus on Research uh making YouTube videos um you know supporting my patreon uh supporters and so on and so you know I think it'll be just a matter of balance uh so this is not nearly as big of a deal I think as the econ the economic you know equality versus inequality now taking a step back though forget the economics for a second let's look at ourselves as a species will we stagnate or will we innovate if we achieve uh biological immortality so a quotation comes to mind and this is just a truism that is said in in the establishment which is science advances one funeral at a time so basically the idea is that uh if you know if if the status quo is maintained and the people that believe in the status quo live forever they continue maintaining the status quo forever and nothing ever changes so do people get stuck in their way um if people continue to get stuck in their way with biological immortality yeah we could end up being a very stagnant species now on the other hand maybe biological immortality helps people stay more open-minded maybe we even develop therapies that keep you open-minded and prevent your mind from calcifying and then hopefully we can get the best of both worlds and so what I mean by that is you're young you're Dynamic you're you you're open-minded but then you also get to accumulate centuries worth of wisdom so let's take a deeper dive into that so on the one hand we could end up with mass paralysis so imagine just do a thought experiment with me for a second imagine that during the um during uh the the height of the Spanish Empire the um the Conquistadors found the Fountain of of Youth and they were able to convey uh the magic of immortality to the king and queen of Spain who were deeply Catholic and then they were able to take that and then basically spread Spanish style Catholicism around the entire world 500 years ago and then the entire world was Frozen with that value system so things like slavery theocracy patriarchy and colonialism become the status quo forever or at least until something major happens because that doesn't preclude the possibility of Civil War Uprising that sort of thing but from a social perspective many of those people that think that hey you know colonialism and slavery was a good idea might still be alive today so what kind of values like need to be sunsetted with funerals so that's something that's that's the downside now I did think of an upside to this though with the rate of change of society it might actually be good to have some Old Guard people pushing the brakes more because I mean the world is changing really fast right now and maybe it's even too fast so if there's a few people that are a little bit more resistant that could be a good thing especially with AI ramping up and and who knows how fast life is going to change I'm not saying that it totally counterbalances it I'm just giving you some food for thought now on the other hand if all of our best Minds live forever whether they're social thinkers or scientists or or spiritual leaders or whatever if they all live forever like that could actually be really good and that could actually support life and the world changing for the better faster because what if Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking were all still alive and all collaborating to make nuclear fusion and warp drive right like that would be pretty cool um and then you know I'm not going to pick any particular spiritual leaders because all of them have their own issues imagine that humans are complicated and the closer you look at them they're all problematic but the point being is that having many leaders in the world that have centuries of wisdom accumulated could actually be a really good thing for us could help stabilize the entire planet and the entire species which I think is on balance probably a good thing so whether it's positive disruption or positive stabilization I do think that overall there are so while there are some pros and cons it's a double-edged sword I think that longevity would be a net positive for the species okay so those are all the issues that I've unpacked now let's dive into the last part of the video which is my specific predictions so in the near term as I mentioned earlier in the video I do believe that longevity medicine is going to be dirt cheap and broadly accessible I think it's going to be cheap because at the at the fundamental level mRNA vaccines not that expensive nanoparticles not that expensive especially once you figure out how to scale them and then finally for accessibility I think that government regulation will ensure that everything is accessible just because that'll be the will of the people but also it makes economic sense to ensure that everyone has access to it and the reason is because well death is expensive uh the economic loss of expertise but also end-of-life care is ludicrously expensive and so just from a purely economic standpoint it makes sense to push for longevity medicine to be cheap and accessible another thing is that it's going to be an array of therapies because there's tens of thousands of diseases and metabolic disorders and genetic flaws and every you know hundreds of thousands millions of things that can go wrong with the body so when we say like you know biological immortality it's not going to be one pill that you take it's going to be bespoke personalized medicine it's going to be injections it might be implants it might be nanites it's going to be a lot of stuff number three is that detection detection and imaging of biological problems needs a little bit more of advancement now that being said I'm not worried about it because I think AI is going to figure that out quick fast and in a hurry so the combination of AI Quantum Computing and Material Science means that you'll probably end up with a implant like in your arm or whatever this just constantly reporting on the content of your blood there was a some like speculative sci-fi kind of documentaries that I watched years ago that um that there the sensors were actually in the toilets so every time you go to the bathroom it it reads you know what's coming out of your body and can use that to infer you know your your health um I don't know that's a little bit weird but hey it's one possible modality um yeah so the fourth one is just kind of a rehash of the different delivery mechanisms okay so here's where it gets fun life in 200 years I predict that due in part to uh the technologies that lead to life extension but also some of the knock-on effects of Life Extension mean that war poverty and disease will all have been solved and so what I mean by that is that our best and brightest whether they're Engineers spiritual leaders political leaders scientists will all be living longer and will be able to help provide a steadying hand not just for you know Global Harmony but also to help solve the problems um so that's going to be I think a really big thing um and 200 years is is going to be close there's probably going to be some big like Global conflicts between now and then um hopefully just one more well hopefully zero more but in all likelihood at least one more unfortunately um number two is because of that aforementioned thing where like most people are going to be empty nesters and so we already have a model for that right like you go to a retirement community some of those people are the happiest people you've ever met so I think everyone is going to move towards that sort of communal living and I don't mean shared ownership I don't mean like communism communal I just mean like Village living and group living um in rural places it'll be more like Villages uh like Eco Villages or that sort of thing and in urban places it'll be like high density co-living situations and of course there will still be a plenty of people who prefer to live alone or just with their partner or Partners if they're non-monogamous overall in 200 years I think that the global population will have stabilized and I know that some people believe that the carrying capacity is like 50 billion or 50 trillion or whatever um you don't want to live on a planet with 50 billion humans I promise you like look into it um so I think that the population will stabilize it could we could still end up with a lot more than we have today maybe 15 billion or 20 billion that would still be pretty crowded um and then Supply chains are going to be really really blah anyways point being I think that uh population will have stabilized within 200 years and because of that there will be very few children there will be economic incentives against having children so this was explored in an episode of Love death and robots where you in order to keep getting your life extending medicine you have to be sterilized um that's a pretty Draconian measure so but depending on the depending on what happens that could become a thing I kind of doubt it I think that people will voluntarily just kind of get over themselves like everyone has one or two children and then they're happy or whatever but you never know because you know grandparents get to the point where they haven't had children in a long time and they're like hey I want grandchildren and you know we are we are biologically wired too like having children around uh some of us some people are like no get children away from me um but yeah oops come back sorry um yes so I think that within 200 years we're gonna still have some some holdouts of the mortalitasi um some probably some small communities and shrinking communities that that prefer the natural uh flow of things hopefully they don't cause any trouble I don't think that they're going to be like um terrorists or anything because that kind of runs contrary but you never know what's going to happen um and also lastly within 200 years I think the governments and corporations will still exist as we know them today nation states and that sort of thing in the long run though I think that that idea that I that I was talking about with the you know decentralized autonomous organizations where everything is run by by hierarchies of AI with human input I think that that's probably going to be like the long-term end game I hope if it's done right and then finally in 2000 years because we're approaching the singularity um you know heck we might figure out faster than light travel before that 200 years is up so let's be honest but what I'm going to say is that within 2000 years we will have figured it out um if faster than light travel is possible we will have figured that out basically in our lifetime because we're probably going to live a long time and if not then Interstellar flight is going to be a thing now what's going to happen as humans spread across the universe is that it takes an astronomical amount of energy to change the habitat of an entire planet which if we solve fusion and have anti-matter reactors and that sort of stuff we will have enough energy to do that but that being said we might not right we might not have enough energy and material because if you run the numbers it would take a tremendous amount of water and and matter to make Mars habitable habitable for instance and Earth-like worlds might be really really far apart um so like too far to get to so it's easier to change ourselves so this is this is what I'm building up to it's easier to change ourselves than an entire planet especially if we have genetic medicine and cybernetic stuff and nanotech and blah blah all that fun stuff so we might adapt ourselves to live on planets that we couldn't currently habitate which means that we we that we as humans might deliberately speciate in order to um in order to spread across the stars and this is kind of in Canon from the Star Trek universe where like they kind of have a really wimpy explanation in one episode in generation Next Generation where like the reason that all aliens have roughly the same body plan is because we all had a you know the same progenitor species billions of years ago or whatever so I don't know if that's going to happen but this is just one possibility if you think of like okay we really want to get onto other planets so what are the implications of that we can either make the planets more Earth-like or we can adapt ourselves or maybe a little bit of of both but over a long enough period of time we might consider like the people on Mars a different species or in Alpha Centauri a different species which could result in like maybe they will actually look like Klingons one day who knows alright so I hope you had a lot of fun thanks for watching don't forget like And subscribe and hop on patreon and also if I got it working we're actually about to jump right over to the live stream q a so I will see you there
