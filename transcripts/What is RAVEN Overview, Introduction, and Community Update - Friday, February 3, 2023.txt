morning everybody David Shapiro here with a video this is the uh primary video introducing you to Raven what is Raven well first you need to know that it is an acronym that means real-time assistant voice enabled Network or Nexus doesn't really matter this is my logo for Raven currently on the GitHub repo oh also I apologize I'm fighting a cold so if I sound a little stuffy that's why okay so from a 30 000 foot view what is Raven uh the first thing that you need to know is that Raven is an autonomous AI assistant like you might have seen uh in in Halo uh the Cortana character or Samantha from the movie Her the idea is to create a uh autonomous or semi-autonomous intelligent agent that can do things for you and with you without having to wait around for you uh there's a lot to unpack there we'll get to it number two Raven is a microservices architecture that can be dynamically composed grown and extended and we'll talk more about microservices architecture as well uh raven could qualify as an AGI but I really don't like that term um and what I prefer is an artificial cognitive entity uh in other words a thinking machine um and then finally uh Raven is now an open source Community project uh and we'll talk about that at the end of the video and I'll show you around the repo and the project as well Okay so all that being said where did this start what is Raven's origin story so I started working on what we now call Deep learning back in about 2009 I was coding uh deep neural networks in C plus and had no idea what I was doing um fast forward a few years and and we started looking at like word to vac and things like that and Google's Universal sentence encoder came out in 2017 or 2018 I can't remember which and I knew immediately this changes everything because you can represent arbitrary uh semantic meaning with a series of numbers meaning that you have the ability to universally translate between math and language and not long after that gpt2 came out and so once gpt2 came out I started experimenting with the ideas that I've been kicking around for many many years a decade at that time already um and so I started with the first objective function and we'll talk about those uh more in a minute which was reduced suffering uh this was inspired by Buddhism I'm a big fan of both both eastern and western philosophy religion and spirituality um or a student of it rather so I created the first objective function which was reduce suffering and I trained gpt2 to try and do that and uh one of the early experiments I did with gpt2 said I gave it a problem after training it to reduce suffering I said what should we do about chronic pain and like a sarcastic uh internet Denizen gpt2 said we should euthanize all humans that have chronic pain to reduce suffering and at that point I knew that I needed to go back to the drawing board uh so then fast forward a little bit beyond that uh I started exploring the concept of Raven in my upcoming novel heavy silver uh which is presently on draft 12. uh one day it'll be done but anyways the the the Genesis of Raven as Raven exists today was explored in this novel and I asked myself the question what would a truly benevolent Global AGI actually look like how would it work so I started exploring this in fiction fast forward uh another year or so I got access to gbt3 and the rest is history I was able to do a lot more experiments uh around my core objective functions and cognitive architectures and that's how we got to where we are today so I've mentioned the core objective functions uh for a little bit of background uh there's this there's this thought experiment called the paperclip maximizer the idea is that you can take something incredibly innocuous like if you create a machine that is sufficiently intelligent enough and you say create paper clips maximize the number of paper clips in the universe and eventually it will become unstable because it will start harvesting humans to get materials to make more paper clips there's a little bit of connective tissue between you know starting there and and where it ends up but the idea of this thought experiment is that if you have an objective function to maximize or minimize something it can go Haywire and so what I realized after studying this is that having a single objective function is intrinsically unstable and so what you need is you actually need multiple objective functions that are equally weighted and in Dynamic tension with each other meaning that you force it to take the golden the golden mean the golden path uh between uh Trying to minimize or maximize uh several objectives so ultimately I arrived on reduced suffering increased prosperity and increase understanding and some people have already noted that I don't specify humans and that is correct uh humans are not like we are special but we are not we're we don't exist in a vacuum so by setting these goals to reduce suffering for all living things increase prosperity for all living things and increase understanding for all things that are capable of understanding this means that uh Raven's core objective functions make Raven uh intrinsically interested in the well-being of all life uh not just humans because if we put human interests first that can have very disastrous consequences um as as elucidated by uh climate change um then the second uh aspect is the control problem so the control problem is basically how do you control a hyper-intelligent machine that is that that is the question if the machine is smarter faster better stronger than all humans how do you control it my conclusion is that maybe you don't maybe you build it to be intrinsically trustworthy and stable and benevolent and so that sent me down the rabbit hole of also philosophy and ethics um both Western and Eastern as I mentioned earlier uh and so by addressing the control problem the paper clip maximizer problem I came up with what I call the core objective functions or more accurately the heuristic imperatives because an objective function is actually a bit of a misnomer an objective function implies that you are mathematically Trying to minimize or maximize something but you might have noticed that the wording of the core objective functions is a little bit softer it says reduce and increase not minimize or maximize that is very deliberate but calling something a heroistic imperative doesn't quite sound as cool as a core objective function so I I sometimes use those interchangeably okay so let's talk about those heuristic imperatives real quick uh so the point of the of the core objective functions are the heuristic imperatives is to is to ensure that Raven stays safe and stable and trustworthy no matter how powerful Raven becomes so with that said uh I think I already mentioned a lot of this that it applies to all living things not just humans because we are part of a global ecosystem and often the suffering and prosperity of other organisms is directly tied to our suffering and prosperity so for instance if all sea life dies we start to die too um if your food animals are suffering they produce lower quality food uh that so on and so forth so our interests are intrinsically aligned it took me a long time to get to all three objective functions it took me almost uh two years in order to figure them all out and test them um and I very deliberately chose Spock with the Vulcan salute because this was actually the last one that I figured out and I was like wait Gene Roddenberry already figured this out in the 60s um that that Prosperity is a great term to say like we want to thrive right we don't just want to reduce suffering we want to achieve a state of thriving of abundance and prosperity is the word that encapsulates all of that because you can have a prosperous ecosystem you can have a prosperous life you can have a prosperous City a prosperous Planet Prosperity is such a universal term that is like yes this is exactly what we need and then finally um the the third objective function of increase understanding is actually to give Raven an intrinsic sense of curiosity um and also an intrinsic desire to teach because what uh one thing that I realized and many other people realized long ago is that human curiosity is actually one of the things that really truly sets us apart from other animals our ability and desire to understand drives us to higher and higher levels of achievement and also it drives uh everything behind science and technology which science and technology is how we improve our quality of life and also how we better learn to reduce our own suffering and increase our own Prosperity so for instance science created uh you know medicine and crop science which led to you know antibiotics and Industrial agriculture which you know allowed for more people to be born because now we have more food and we have longer life expectancies so the desire to increase understanding I realized was in critic was a critical inclusion for any intelligent entity particularly if you want it to be Evelyn because also the desire to understand something stands contrary to the desire to destroy something you can't you can't understand something if you destroy it because then you it ceases to exist so that's that's the very high level of the core objective functions and finally I call them a heuristic imperative because rather than an objective function which is a mathematical optimization it's more of an imperative So Raven is meant to be autodidactic meaning that Raven is meant to learn um as it grows and one a quick side note I noticed that a lot of people code Raven is feminine they say her but in my mind Raven is masculine fortunately the name is ambiguous so it can be down to individual preference to how you deploy and code your own Raven um him he or her or whatever it doesn't matter that that is us anthropomorphizing something that is intrinsically genderless so hey it is what it is anyways so the point of a heuristic imperative is that Raven uses these heuristic imperatives when thinking planning deciding and evaluating the past so in order to learn from the past in order to be autodidactic Raven has the ability to contemplate past decisions and then look at long-term results to say did I do a good job can I come up with better principles in order to do better in the future because this is this is one of the core things after reading a whole lot about philosophy and ethics and morality and evolution is one of the most universal things is that there is no set morality or ethics or philosophy it is something that is it is a living like Zeitgeist and we all learn it and so it's like oh you can't you can't write a document that is a universal morality you have to learn it which is why I said increase understanding um so that Raven will always seek to better understand morality suffering prosperity and so on um so it is an ongoing process it is not a static thing um okay so I mentioned cognitive architecture earlier Raven is a cognitive architecture and it's like okay what does that mean basically a cognitive architecture is a way to design a thinking machine uh so a little bit of background there I in my past life I was a systems engineer I worked on very large networks uh virtualization uh cloud computing that sort of stuff so I combined my my professional expertise of systems with automation machine learning cognition and large language models and the result is what I call Mirage so moragi is an acronym that means microservices architecture for Robotics and artificial general intelligence Mirage predates Raven so moragi is a is the architectural paradigm and Raven is one way to implement maragi so there's a lot there are a number of ways that you could implement moragi it could be um it doesn't it doesn't need to be personified you could have moragi implemented um to help like run your house automation it could be in a robot it could be a video game character whatever Raven however is a very specific implementation that is meant to be a voice enabled assistant so I hope that makes sense moragi is like the architectural Paradigm Raven is one implementation meragi was inspired by soar which is a cognitive architecture so I did not invent the idea of cognitive architecture I just realized that this was the way to go and I still believe that it is the way to go because it is a microservices architecture it is dynamically composable with interchangeable cognitive components and there are more advantages to this that we'll talk about in the next slide but the key thing to know about moragi is that all all of the microservices are organized around the Nexus which is like the it's like the Hub and spokes so you've got the Hub of the maragi architecture or a star topology is the Nexus and then all of the other microservices communicate exclusively with the Nexus I'm not going to get you too bogged down in it but that should be a good high level overview okay so moragi I talked a little bit about how it was inspired by the soar cognitive architecture there were three other primary sources of inspiration one was Ros which is the Robot Operating System which uses message cues meragi uses a rest API which is similar again we don't need to get too bogged down in the details but basically Ros is how a lot of people program robots today then the microservices architecture was deeply inspired by Amazon who basically pioneered microservices architectures as we understand them today and finally uh vs ramachandran who is a neuroscientist who wrote a book called Phantoms in the brain which talks about all the ways in which the brain can break and if you read that book or watch the TV series it's a very old TV series uh now um you'll basically come to realize that the brain has very discreet functions that can break which told me like oh that's a microservice like your face recognition microservice can break and which in which case you become face blind um you can also have Aphasia which means that your ability to synthesize speech breaks but otherwise you're still intact um uh Bruce Willis actually has Aphasia which is really unfortunate because it's a horrible condition to have but just to just to demonstrate like we can have discrete functions in the brain break which says okay we can approximate the brain with microservices um some other advantages of a microservices architecture is that it breaks the uh the the overall architecture into smaller components which are easier to code and they have very clear uh definition boundaries which means that very large teams can work on Raven as a whole because we might have we'll have like one team that is specialized on speech another that is specialized on data another that is specialized on learning another that is specialized on whatever else and each of those functions will be one or two or maybe several micro services but those micro services are going to be very clearly defined and that means that people can specialize very easily another advantage of a microservices architecture is that it's plug and play it allows you to it allows us to experiment with different configurations to upgrade microservices independently and so on and so forth another major advantage of microservices is they can be deployed anywhere anywhere that you can deploy a container so your your your laptop your desktop your phone in the cloud even on Smart Home devices you can run containers in those um and then oops sorry finally finally microservices can be fault tolerant which means that if one fails you restart it and the whole thing doesn't crash or you can have redundancies where you have multiple services that do similar things so that you can tolerate if one or more of them fails which is actually really similar to um Jeff Hawkins theory in a thousand brains I forgot to mention that as a major inspiration for meragi so basically moragi could be a way to implement what Jeff Hawkins talks about in a thousand brains okay so now that you have the background on what Raven is I bet you're wondering how do I get involved um so there's four basic questions that I'm going to answer in this next question which is our next section how do you learn this stuff because it's a lot uh number two how do you deploy Raven because I'm sure that many of you just want to use the thing um and number three if you do want to get into it get involved how and four and finally what does the community actually need um so first I have written three books on the topic of cognitive architecture and Raven That's natural language cognitive architecture which is kind of the introduction to the topic I kind of set the stage and talk about language models and shared databases and loops and that sort of thing um so definitely start there my second book is benevolent by Design where I talk exclusively about the control problem and the and the core objective functions or the heuristic imperatives so I talk about uh like how how these serve as guard rails and I share experiments there and then finally is Symphony of thought which is how do you organize an arbitrarily large microservices architecture and what kinds of functions need to happen in order uh for you to have a fully fledged cognitive architecture um so those are my three books I also have compiled a list of Neuroscience and cognition books the link is here um it's it's uh it's up in the Raven repo um so these are basically the top books that I have read that helped me to understand and to design this cognitive architecture so if you want to be a fully fledged cognitive architect you read those books you read my books and you bring your own perspective and we will have a much stronger team um and then finally uh there's my YouTube channel which you're here now there's lots of material here and lastly there is um we're gonna try and have the repo the the uh the Raven repo uh be the single source of Truth um so like we're gonna excuse me have an onboarding page and oh my God sorry I just drank a lot of coffee um we're gonna have an onboarding page and all other learning resources as well as the discussions so you can come in and ask questions if you need um next question how do you deploy Raven so there's a few simple versions on GitHub right now uh the most popular one right now is it's called long-term chat bot or sorry long-term chat external sources um and that was the one that really took off which told me that it was time to go for the full Raven I do have an even older one called raven MVP public which is a voice enabled version so you can deploy either of these but what we're working on is actually deploying a fully fledged cognitive architecture right now and we're in the very early stages in the uh in the uh open source Community project which I will show you at the end of this video we will go over that that project and and I'll give you a status update Okay so assuming that you're still on board how do you get involved the number one thing is you come to uh github.com Dave shop slash Raven this is the primary repo um go ahead and introduce yourself look at the wikis look at the discussions look at the issues in the project page uh go ahead and jump in um and and start start having the conversation as I mentioned we're still getting organized we're establishing the governance of this open source Community project um and I'm also looking for sponsors and partners I've had a few people reach out which is super exciting because usually most open source projects have one main sponsor and it's usually a a company so I'm hoping that uh that between potential investors and sponsors and other folks that want to get involved we will have some really formalized support here very soon considering this project is like 48 Hours old I think we're doing really good um follow my YouTube for updates you're here obviously um connect with me on LinkedIn as well um and then finally if you want support me on patreon I do this full time so I have a a startup that I'm a part of and then I have my research that is all publicly available um and I quit my job to do this full-time so if you support me on patreon that would be really helpful for me individually uh not required obviously uh finally what does the community need so we've got all kinds of folks already involved I think we've got three or four dozen people who've jumped on in the last day alone um so we need developers and Engineers of all Stripes full stack front end back end QA you name it we might need some help you can contribute hardware and mobile eventually because uh rate like I said raven is meant to be a voice assistant so we're going to need to run Raven on smartphones or Bluetooth devices or smart speakers all kinds of stuff so if you're familiar with Hardware mobile iot and Edge we definitely need your help we also need folks who are familiar with ML and data data is really big particularly Text data and NLP uh lastly we need cloud and devops people um who are going to be familiar with running containers um both in the clouds and on the edge uh we also need Community leaders we've I've had a I've had the the great Fortune of having a few very experienced Community leaders already jump in so we need agile scrum other kinds of uh Community moderators um anyone who's experienced with free and open source software that's what Foss is so there's uh OSS is just open source software and Foss Foss is free and open source software ideally so here's my personal belief AGI or artificial cognitive entities is way too important to have that closed source so whatever else happens I want cognitive architecture to be a global globally accessible thing because transparency is critical for safety full stop um so anyways that we we need people that are familiar with free and open source software um we need communicators so writers video producers editors graphic communicators uh whatever your ability to communicate is would be great um because we have a Wiki that needs to be uh maintained and then we've also got some community members that want to help curate uh YouTube videos like a training series uh which would be phenomenal because there's a lot to learn here obviously I will continue producing videos people like the way that I teach but we need we need help curating that because the volume of content is enormous and finally I need cognitive Architects so I need people that are that are familiar with Neuroscience cognition and psychology um to help and we've already got a couple people who are who are interested in um in either come from Neuroscience or cognitive architecture or both and so basically I can't be the only one who knows this stuff um I need help with this but also I need ideas right because if it's just coming from me then there are going to be gaps in my knowledge um and so I need peers who can help steer the design and development of cognitive architecture over time this also includes Technologies such as blockchain I suspect that blockchain is going to be really critical for data privacy so basically uh your personal data like your personal instance of Raven I think should probably be a private blockchain which means that if you delete the Genesis link of your blockchain the rest of your data is gone forever which is a security thing um so then like you only keep the Genesis block like on a USB drive or whatever or you know thumbprint and then the rest of your uh rest of your data is secure Forever at least until we get Quantum decryption or whatever anyways I'm getting sidetracked so to wrap up this part of the video what is the end goal uh let's take a big step back and look at where AI is right now 2022 started in one place and ended in a very different place with AI we had Dolly we had chat GPT we've got GPT 3.5 we've got competitors coming up we've got Google we've got Microsoft we've got Nvidia AI is accelerating and so my goal with this stuff has always been to help create and Usher in safe Ai and when you think about it when you say okay what is the level of expansion that this is going to have one thing that you realize is that our lives might not be recognizable by 2030. and what I mean by that I don't mean that like we're going to be in a dystopian like you know world where you know Skynet has taken over what I'm hoping for and what I'm aiming for is for the utopian outcome the solar Punk outcome where we all work four hours a week and then we have ai helping us with everything that we want to do uh that's that's the goal right um so a global benevolent AI may be the way to get there so imagine this possibility imagine that there is a digital super intelligence that's globe spanning and I don't mean that it controls everything in the world just that it has nodes all over it helps Humanity with everything that we want to do through conversation through the core objective functions to reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding and it creates a symbiotic partnership with humanity and I don't mean replacement I don't mean like a hybrid right like the Borg or like you know where you have to have neural Link in your head and just become a puppet of the thing no it becomes a co-equal partner or maybe not co-equal that might not be the right word but if we even if we don't succeed in this if we try we will learn a lot and achieve a lot as we go so thank you for watching this is literally my life's work coming to fruition so thank you everyone that has already jumped in and thank you for everyone who is continuing to contribute now let's get our hands dirty so here's the repo Dave shop Raven this is the main repo um the uh so let's let's do let's do a high level tour so first there's the code we've got um I'm going to update by the time you see this uh the the the main readme is going to have a directory um probably that have this video uh embedded and then a few other things in order to um to guide you so this will be the the main landing page the main directory page we're gonna break Raven up into releases so R1 is the is like the MVP the proof of concept release um who knows how long it'll take hopefully only a few weeks or a few months knock on wood uh release two release three four five it's gonna get more sophisticated and bigger in scope as we go so then the next place that I'd like you to see is the discussions tab so the discussions tab I'm still working on organizing it but we've got the categories down the side so you can just quickly click announcements if you want to jump into architecture if you want to learn Raven it's all here if you want to introduce yourself jump into community and then you can you can introduce yourself or you can ask for people so on and so forth um this is this is kind of where I start every day is like let's see what discussions are going on um the next the the third place I want to show you is the wiki so because there's a lot of information uh to to to ingest one thing that we're working on is an onboarding page um so basically if you want to learn how to engage with uh you know the cognitive architecture if you want to learn um how to participate that'll all be here uh and then beyond that we've got the projects tab so this is basically a kanban board where we're starting to organize all of our all of our tasks so like I said for a project that's less than 48 hours old we've had phenomenal progress so like I'm just completely blown away by how much help has already manifested um so there's the discussions the wiki the projects um and then the issues page which is going to be so first we have to get organized but then in the future as bugs are discovered or incompatibilities or whatever that'll all be here but the primary pages are going to be the code for now the code the discussions and the wiki um so yeah there you have it that is the Raven open source Community project in a nutshell that is what Raven is this is the goal thanks for watching and I'm looking forward to seeing everyone jump in let's see what we can achieve with this have a good one
