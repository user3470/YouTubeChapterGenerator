hey everybody David Shapiro here with a more uh conventional video so um on my patreon um and throughout all of my time on YouTube one of the questions that I get the most is uh with prompt engineering and one thing that I've noticed is that uh many folks um are are working on prompt engineering and in some cases English is not their first language and so this video is going to be primarily for people who for whom English is not your first language and so for instance In some cultures you're more likely to use the passive voice so this is particularly for um for uh folks from India and Japan where you kind of insinuate what you need and and the the reason is because in these cultures it's considered impolite or rude to be direct but that being said these models and these models I mean gpt3 and chat GPT they're trained with a western mindset and so what I'm what I mean by that is that they responded to imperatives to commands and if you're a Spanish speaker bandatos so that's actually where I originally kind of learned that concept is like oh it's a command word uh or or a imperative sentence or um that sort of thing so what I what I have started telling people uh if you're not a native English speaker use chat GPT to to get the intent across and to write it in in good English but you need to understand that imperative so you say write instructions not like you know uh the chatbot should write this blah blah you know you got to be direct so I got a couple of examples and so and and these are inspired by by questions that I've actually gotten so in one write product reviews for uh for some uh wine given some basic facts so let's ask chat gbt uh are you familiar with uh prompt engineering and so what I'm doing here is I am uh priming this conversation so the chat GPT knows what it is that we're doing so it's like okay I understand the concept of prompt engineering that's what we're working on cool and so that's that's it I just needed that information in the context window so that that way it knows what we're about to do cool uh help me write a DaVinci prompt for um uh for writing uh wine uh descriptions for an online uh store um my database has a few uh Fields um such as year location type of wine flavor profile bouquet I think I spelled that right and so on um we need a prompt that will write incredibly vivid descriptions um for each wine um they should be flowery or romantic um or even sultry in some cases where appropriate um for instance uh like imagine that the description is written by a professional French sommelier um okay can you take a crack at that prompt so what we do is that for for iterative purposes because you have no idea what it's going to do um there we go there we go so this is actually off to a great start so all I did was I described the prompt and so let me unpack what I did here so I said write a DaVinci prompt for me I'm assuming that chat GPT knows what DaVinci is um I don't know if it does but it's being constantly updated so who knows but it does say open AI DaVinci so it did connect that DaVinci is from openai Okay cool so chat GPT knows how to write prompts all right so as of professional French sommelier write a captivating ooh ooh I like that captivating description of a year type of wine from location so these are the placeholders with flavor profile and Bouquet transport the reader to the vineyard and let them savor every sip oh that is good um example so then uh as a this that and the other okay so it gave this as okay so this this is basically going to be a few shot right so we're saying here's an example um yep so we need to fill in the blanks for this for the few shot okay so let me let me slow down because I know that I'm going really fast so what it did was it produced here's the prompt right and then here is an example of how it would look right and so we'll need to do a little bit of formatting um and and this is get basically like so I'm going to tell it let's use this as a few shot example so we can get exactly the the behavior that we want um tantalizing creation as a friend as a professional French sommelier I invite you to do blah blah um okay so what's what's wrong with this we don't want it to say as a professional French sommelier um this is a good start but we don't want um the response to open with as a professional French sommelier um the user will probably uh not care um instead let's um write the prompt in such a way that it uses um uh uses a kind of a third perspective so for instance it will reply or it will say this bottle will um transport you make sense um can you try a slightly modified version of this prompt sure here's a modified version okay now it's getting confused hmm so now that's that's not what I was looking for no that's not what I was looking for let's start over um let's just write the prompt let's adopt a new format where the opening prompt is labeled as prompt in your response and then the completion is also labeled with all caps so the prompt should include the Persona of a sommelier but the most important thing is to write the Vivid description of the wine based upon the input variables try again please there we go all right so it says write a captivating wine description from the perspective of a French sommelier for a year blah blah blah okay cool um yeah this is pretty simple so one thing I will say is that less is often more so you see how this prompt got shorter and shorter we should actually try this this is pretty simple um so it may work can you fill in the variables for me so I can try it and then what we're going to do from Napa Valley with a buttery flavor profile that hints of vanilla and Oak okay cool um so what we're going to do is we're going to actually take this platform and we're gonna um description so we're going to actually see what it does now I lately I turned the temperature down to zero because I want to see what the model produces without any variance um let's see 250 that's probably enough it's a truly Exquisite wine blah blah blah okay so now what I can do is I can take this output and say I liked this output but I was hoping it would be a little bit more so this output is good but I'd like for it to be a little bit longer okay great um I tried it and got the following output um so this is really great but I'd like to add a bit about um when and where this wine would be good please update modify expand the prompt so that it will include uh stuff like food pairings but also really engage the users um not user the uh wine uh buyers imagination they need to know exactly how they're going to use this wine going to use this wine all right so now please write a new new prompt um with this in mind um the last one was pretty good okay cool excellent and I just hit Escape because I don't need it like chat GPT is hallucinating what the output might be and that's fine because it's like it gives you an idea of but then you need to test it okay great can you uh fill in the blanks fill in the variables of that last prompt so I can test excuse me okay so then we'll grab this and come back over here Okay so um describe how this wine can be enjoyed what dishes it pairs well with and how it will enhance the overall dining experience is a truly captivating wine um it's fruity flavor is balanced by floral bouquet making a delightful complex experience on the palette you'll find notes of ripe cherries raspberries and hints of spice cool I don't know if it's lying but okay um Pinot Noir pairs wonderfully with a variety of dishes from light salads to heartier fair is fruity notes make it a great companion accompaniment sorry to grilled salmon or roasted chicken there you go um experience sure to enhance any dining experience it's complexity and balance make it a great choice for any occasion um cool so I was at the grocery store with my fiance and there was um there was a brand of wine that was like you know it was it was very sultry it was like um uh like you know the the delicate velvet on your lips is sure to like basically turn you on um so what we want to do now is we want to add one final variable so that the um whoever's writing this can um add a tone um great great that worked uh really well um let's add one last variable to The Prompt um I want my users Wine sellers to be able to specify a tone so for instance some Shoppers are going to be very uh haughty and serious about their wine so we need to um create a variable that will allow for that but some wine brands are going to be um to be sillier or um basically just eight or two different audiences so can you modify the prompt one last time to include a um uh uh uh target audience tone kind of thing I'm not sure the best way to modify the prompt okay let's see what it does so chat GPT is pretty smart um tailored for a specific no um let's see that's not what I was looking for no that's not good uh you removed the bit about food pairings and such bring that back so let's see um let's bring that back um just modify this following prompt by adding a new tone variable or something like that all right I apologize for the confusion it's very uh recalcitrant is that the word contrite Contrition okay write a captivating review blah blah blah tailor the tone for a specific audience no you're not using the tone you did not add a tone variable you just you just rambled off the list of tones I suggested as possible variables so it might sound like I'm being really rude to the machine right now um there we go so now we've got this all right so let's add this to our prompt tailor the tone of the description to a specific tardy Audience by using the variable uh that's like really well let's see if it works let's see if it works I I might be jumping to conclusions um so we'll say something like target audience tone is going to be um uh let's see young 20 something [Music] um women okay cool no that didn't work laughs you don't advertise to Young 20-something women by saying you're a young 20-something woman um yeah that didn't work that's kind of funny um all right so let's use let's use more adjectives because in this case it's like the the model is like very um Let's do let's do uh fun and silly all right it's a fun and silly wine no super not what I want all right okay I tried this and uh it is an unmitigated disaster prompt completion what do you think is wrong with this prompt got any ideas how to fix it foreign okay why don't we try changing the line this seems off and we simplify this um part of the prompt removed the variable again [Laughter] and then it says tailor the tone okay the best fits your brand um all right let's see it's clear that you are lost um foreign remember that a prompt is static so including a description or a a line in the prompt like um does not make any sense can you try something completely different there we go tailor the tone for the description of your target audiences like no now you're completely lost okay this is getting aggravating actually um uh okay because what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to show you how to get chat EBT to do this but Chad GPT is obviously not um getting it so remember simpler is better um stop with the um ludicrously long um prompt just use a simple tone variable please okay it doesn't get it uh it really really doesn't get it um all right so here's how I would do it and I apologize but I hope as we we found out we found a limit um tone of the description fun and silly there we go this is what I was trying to get it to do and I was like simpler is better um so then we say um so then we say like uh let's see um uh let's see luxurious and sensual this is for the the snoo to your clients just said it's a luxurious and Central experience okay whatever it's not perfect but you can see we made some progress all right so let's move on to a different prompt altogether so OSHA this is actually one that I've gotten several questions um about over the years um and it's about like regulations and stuff so let's delete this um let's see help me write a uh Da Vinci um gpt3 prompt for uh citing OSHA regulations um given an employee complaint can you take a crack at this um label the prompt with prompt and completion with completion all right you're an HR representative for a Manufacturing Company an employee has filed a complaint um okay no all right good start but we need a placeholder in the prompt for the employee complaint um um the employee complaint should not be in line with the description um think of it more like a form the complaint may be a sentence or a whole paragraph so create some additional framing for it no I don't like that use new lines to frame the complaint better remember write it more like a form there we go okay cool great now let's um imagine an employee complaint for testing can you imagine a an employee complaint let's say realistic realistic employee complaint um on a warehouse floor involving a forklift no don't include the prompt just write the complaint only on several occasions I've witnessed forklifts after driving at excessive speeds such as honking the horn before not following okay cool cool now let's rewrite this with broken English um imagine that the employee is not a native English speaker so we're basically going to write this prompt to see if it is resilient and not follow safety cool this is dangerous for me please do something to fix now now to fix thank you cool great so let's try this um all right you are an HR representative so let's come back over here employee complaint and let's grab the complaint and my brother and I lived in an apartment like 15 years ago uh maybe not that long ago but the uh the the the neighborhood handyman actually wrote like this um and he was very helpful very sweet guy but just did not have a good command of English and you imagine that that many people who work dangerous jobs are not native English speakers okay so um whoops OSHA response let's see what it says okay all right cool I tested the um The Prompt and complaint but it uh did not cite any specific OSHA regulations um it just gave me a generic list of steps um foreign this prompt is meant to give internal HR a list of regulations to look up for reference can you can you modify the prompt um to list only OSHA regulations okay it's still it's still saying and outline the steps that we're going to take but I don't think that that's what we want it to do so let's grab this let's see and it just parroted this back at me um yep no we don't want to um give the response to the employee so remove the bit about steps will take remember the entire point of this is just to list OSHA regulations please rewrite the entire prompt from the beginning actually here here's what we're going to do um this is this is another Advanced technique which is um you ask it to to summarize everything that we're doing so far can you recap and summarize everything we're doing not quite take a big step back what are we doing here zoom out we are creating a prompt and an employee complaint for an HR representative at a Manufacturing Company involving unsafe working conditions blah blah okay yep good good good okay now describe the goal of the prompt wrong we are not replying to the uh employee we are only generating OSHA citations for HR to investigate say regulations can you restate the purpose of the prompt now and so when you do this when you ask it like wait tell me what you're thinking then you can see the misunderstanding there we go great now please write a brand new prompt that accepts the uh employ the complaint and sites regulations stop with the steps that the company will take we are not doing that foreign that is not even the same prompt no [Laughter] there we go I didn't actually know if that would work okay cool let's see if this works employee complaint and then whoops instead of Osha response I probably need to say OSHA regulations whoa I wonder if these are right probably not powered industrial trucks I'll be darned oh cool um let's see we're looking for 178 oh loading I'll be darned okay so now let's try this let's remove this and see if it still knows I'll be darned okay so even when I removed it it still knows the regulations I think we can call this a victory damn I'm actually impressed okay um yeah because one thing that a lot of people mistake is that uh the model already knows a lot so you need to see if the model already has that information and this video is getting long we're already at 30 minutes so I think we'll call it a day we'll maybe do chat bot prompting in the future but uh I hope you found this valuable thanks for watching
