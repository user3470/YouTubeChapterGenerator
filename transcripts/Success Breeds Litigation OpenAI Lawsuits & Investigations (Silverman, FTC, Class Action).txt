morning everybody uh David Shapiro here with a video so many years ago I was listening to or watching a video about the founders of Google and they made a joke that success breeds litigation and that uh that little Mantra that truism has really kind of stuck in my mind for many years and uh it has proven to be true for open AI so I wasn't gonna make this video until I saw that like okay there's a few things stacking up so first there's the class action lawsuit against open AI so this is public filing uh which which has 15 allegations 15 causes of action and it's also got a handful of uh plaintiffs so uh I'm not a lawyer so first I just need to say that everything I say here is my uh amateur novice opinion I did however talk to a lawyer friend of mine uh about a civil procedure and uh how they might go about defending uh this so I do have a tiny bit of understanding um but and I'll also walk you through the process of what I have done anyways so with all that framing in place uh this is this is the class action lawsuit it's 157 Pages uh which is quite a bit um and it goes through all kinds of spicy stuff uh some of it seems kind of unrelevant like they're citing Stephen Hawking who is dead so I'm like okay I know that like they're they're they're trying to provide some context because here's the thing is uh in in conferring with my lawyer friend um he said that the primary audience of this kind of thing is the judge so the judge is going to read this and so you have to provide enough context so that the judge understands what's at stake here now with all that being said they cite stuff like Stephen Hawking and other people talking about like the existential risks of AI to humanity and then dive into civil complaints which I'm like okay these don't seem necessarily related but they also talk about stuff that is specifically germane to open AI for instance the fact that open AI started as an open source non-profit company and not as Elon Musk pointed out now neither of those is any longer true so you see that right here open AI was originally founded as a non-profit research organization with a single Mission but then it abruptly restructured itself and of course the way that it is um the way that it is worded is meant to be a little bit inflammatory because again you have to make it seem like yes the plaintiffs have a case here uh and so from a from a procedural standpoint what my lawyer friend said is that uh if you're defending against this first you try and get it thrown out on procedure is it filed in the correct uh Court um do the do the plaintiffs have standing uh and that sort of thing and and they're like uh if uh if if you have statutes versus procedure like you can win just on procedure so probably what's going to happen is as open AI they're lawyers their their counsel is probably going to try and get it dismissed just on you know grounds of like you know the plaintiffs don't have standing that sort of thing so one thing that was observed very quickly is that the plaintiffs here um are all Sudan pseudonym it's just it's just their uh their I can't say the word pseudonyms they use pseudonyms there we go um rather than their full names and they actually explain in this complaint that the reason that they did that is because um in other cases uh when when uh class action lawsuits have been brought against tech companies uh some plaintiffs have had uh have had death threats and have had to go into like you know hiding or or otherwise seek protection and so they argue that that using pseudonyms is legitimate here because uh because it's um it's generally like in in an interest of their safety uh but of course because we are a court system that values transparency these filings have to be made public so that's that's the first one and Oh and before we move on um some of the uh some of the complaints are some of the allegations are violations of electronic communications and privacy violation of Computer Fraud and Abuse Act violation of Cal California invasion of privacy unfair competition Illinois's biometric information privacy Illinois Consumer Fraud and deceptive business practices Illinois Consumer Fraud and deceptive business practices again negligence invasion of privacy in intrusion upon seclusion I'm not sure what that means larceny or a receipt of stolen property conversion I'm also not sure what that one is unjust enrichment so unjust enrichment means basically that uh you know one party was able to benefit uh unfairly from something that they received from another party and either I think either didn't compensate them correctly or had no business with that material in the first place failure to warn and then New York General business law so this is this is a very expansive uh complaint and it is 157 pages so that's the first one the second one that came out was Sarah Silverman of of all people who is a actress and comedian and a few others so Sarah Silverman Christopher golden and Richard Cadre I'm not sure who those other folks are but uh so this is this is also a class action suit but is much smaller it also demands a jury trial and they didn't list out the uh the infractions quite as cleanly here um but we'll get to how I how I processed all that and then finally is uh FTC versus open AI so the FTC has uh this is not a civil uh complaint this is an investig investigation uh from a regulator so it's a entirely different venue entirely different purpose um and basically this is just a demand for uh evidence and documentation and that sort of stuff it's a lot um the the the the things that they demand it's comprehensive um down to what data they collect how they collect it how they Safeguard it how their authentication Works who they've licensed it to all kinds of stuff so it's a very very wide-ranging comprehensive um uh demand CID so it was that civil investigation demand and so basically it's not they're not suing open AI they are investigating open AI for Regulatory Compliance and there's a lot of overlap between particularly this uh this one the FTC as well as the initial class action lawsuit um and so basically what I did was I scraped all the PDFs and in in some cases if a PDF is correctly printed um then all you have to do is just copy paste the text and then you can use it now for the class action one that's 157 Pages it was like 450 000 characters which is super long there's also a lot of garbage a lot of wreckage that ends up in it like all the page headings and stuff and it looks kind of like this where you've got a whole bunch of Superfluous stuff so I used a bunch of regex to clean this up and I got it down to 360 000 characters uh so that's still that's still a good chunk of text and it's way way way more than uh anything open AI can consume right now but it's not more than Claude can consume um so same thing for uh Silverman this is a much shorter uh complaint it's only 17 pages oh and the the core thing about Sarah Silverman's excuse me um uh complain is it it's about it's fundamentally about copyright in short they allege that open AI uh used uh their their copyrighted works in the training and they cite some evidence as to why they believe that happen and their their assertion is that this is a violation of their rights uh the the particularly copyrights and we'll get into more detail about those in just a minute um now okay so that's what they allege uh and those are those are what I did for the FTC one so this is a thing is the US government is garbage at PDFs and so you go to the top and it's like okay you can't select anything um and then you come down here and it selects it in big giant blocks um and so we we saw this for like pretty much every time the US government releases a PDF it is freaking broken um whereas here you see like I can just highlight all of it and it's actually correctly formatted so what I had to do was I had to reprint this PDF using Microsoft PDF printer and then OCR it to get the text out all right so then what I did was I came over to Claude And I because Claude allows you to attach it I said hey so this is the Silverman one I said can you tell me the main causes of action in this complaint in other words what are the main allegations and so Claude says based on my review of the complaint oh and by the way uh do not use these models to actually defend yourself I'm just saying hey tell me what's in this document um I think that that's a fair and responsible use of language model technology is just tell me what's here so direct copyright infringement against openai for allegedly copying and using the plaintiff's copyrighted books without permission to train its AI models like gpt3 and chat GPT a vicarious copyright infringement against openai for the outputs of its AI models like chat GPT allegedly containing infringing derivative Works based on the plaintiff's books that were used in training violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act dmca for allegedly removing copyright management information from the plaintiff's books when using them to train AI models violations of California's unfair competition laws so that's you know this is something that's held in common with the other complaint and I'm not saying that they're working together when I say held in common I just mean that like they're making similar allegations negligence against open AI for allegedly breaching its duty of care so this is another thing the duty of care and negligence and then unjust enrichment again so both of these class action lawsuits cite that um let's see now the evidence so interestingly the Sarah Silverman case does cite evidence um uh in references AI open ai's own papers that discuss AI model training AI models like GPT one three and four on data sets of books including quote unpublished books and internet-based data sets this helps them allege that they copied books without permission it alleges the size of open ai's books 1 and books 2 data sets appears to match the size of known book piracy sites suggesting openai might have used pirated books so that is a pretty damning indictment or allegation rather because okay if openai got on you know the tour Network and torrented uh you know book piracy uh you know that could be problematic uh it it remains to be seen though um again as a completely uneducated uh wild ass guess my guess would be is that one if openai even did that if they even if if they did pirate books they might have consulted their attorneys and said you're not you're not redistributing these books um and and in fact there is a fair amount of uh precedent set that that uh consuming data for models is not you know like that that it's not uh been it's not a violation uh that basically if you get if you get uh text Data from the internet you can always use that for training AI models now that if that precedent won if I understand that precedent correctly um and two if it's actually true that was still set before large language models so the idea that you could use uh pirated text for models would have been like for classification right um for for creating a bag of words uh classifiers that sort of thing not generators so remember generative AI is new so it has not been litigated in the context of generative AI because literally generative AI is only a couple years old so any precedent that had been set was based on Old School Technology so that's my again uneducated uh and only quasi-professional opinion um okay so it provides sample outputs from chat GPT accurately summarizing books written by the plaintiff authors this helps allege chat GPT was likely trained on those books so in this case I 100 disagree because if if the book was discussed on Amazon reviews on comments on Reddit uh it knows about the book just by virtue of um oh it's raining outside sorry I don't I if you hear the background noise it's raining um but you shouldn't anyways sorry um so you can ask it to summarize something that it hasn't read and all it's all it's doing is regurgitating the other summaries that it has already read and I realized this uh very early on when I went to chat gbt or gpt3 before it was chat GPT and I asked it to write the opening lines of like Of Mice and Men or something and it got it completely wrong it was just guessing it was just confabulating so that told me that it hadn't it maybe not Of Mice and Men but something more recent and copyrighted and that told me that it hadn't actually read the book that it was not in its training data but that it was that it knew about the book because it had read about people talking about it but then when I asked it to actually generate the material it couldn't um so I don't the basically the entire premise of this class action lawsuit could be wrong it all depends on what's in the training data but then if it is in the training data so there's there's several tests here if Sarah Silverman's books are in the training data then it still has to be litigated and there still has to be several tests of is this actually a copyright violation because if it only regurgitates a summary then who cares right if it's not actually you know you're allowed to talk about a book right but if it's not actually if it if it doesn't actually mentally contain Sarah Silverman's actual copyrighted material then uh anything that it's producing is just confabulation or hallucination because it thinks it knows about the book by virtue of having read about other people and so it's inferring or imputing about the copyrighted works now that being said if this is the because this this will come out in Discovery so from a technical standpoint I would be really curious to know what happens if it one like okay so whether or not open AI used copyrighted books might not be the point here because if the model knows enough about the copyrighted material to still infringe upon their rights that could be a really serious blow to to the um to the the ability to use open source data sets now that being said uh generative AI is is generating more text than humans are now uh you know open AIS models generate literally billions of words per day probably per hour at this point honestly and so basically what's going to happen is if here's what I expect is going to happen and I listened to some of the um the the uh us United States Congress Congressional hearing on copyright and Ai and so basically what's going to happen is that if if human produce copyrighted material is just too dangerous to use then every AI shop is just going to switch to 100 AI generated everything whether it's images text uh music whatever and so then you're you're just going to force them to take humans out of the loop entirely and you're going to create an entirely separate information domain that's kind of what I think is going to happen anyways just because just by sheer virtue of the fact that most uh digital media is going to be produced by AI before before long anyways this could be one of the first components of that it lists registered copyrights owned by the plaintiff offer plaintiff authors showing they have valid copyrights okay sure all right so um and I so then I asked like as a as a matter of procedure could open AI be subpoenaed otherwise compelled to share evidence such as their training data yes so here's the thing here's what's really going to be interesting is that um now obviously open AI has rights to protect their Trade Secrets and that sort of thing but um they they can they can do depositions they can serve document requests they can do all kinds of stuff to try and compel open AI to like prove whether or not they used this information um now so that's going to be really interesting again uh you know the courts do their best to try and respect um uh private information intellectual property uh Trade Secrets and that sort of stuff um but really the core issue here is is a matter of copyright um and then the damages of course would be based on um you know any any economic loss there but also violation of Rights so here's the thing with with um that I'm learning about this is that there has to be an injury to the plaintiff and the injury could be Financial loss it could be emotional harm it and it can also just be a violation of Rights like you violated my rights and that is the end that is the injury um and so then what I talked what I talked about here is is this uh you know I said my view is that the model very well could know about the plaintiffs works by sheer virtue of reading about people talking about it on Reddit it could then infer or impute the contents of the copyrighted material but that would have to be litigated and come out in Discovery um you know so it's like maybe it just knows about the material and has never actually seen it and if it hasn't I suspect that this uh that this class action lawsuit is dead in the water it could get appealed um but but really if it comes down to like if they have if they cannot compel open AI or provide any evidence that openai used their copyrighted material then everything else that it is capable of is an emergent capability of uh the training process you know by learning general concepts and styles of writing allowed to convince and Link generate content in a similar voice but without copyrighting the specifics obviously this is just discussing it I'm not saying that this is this is the actual legal test um but just kind of talking about the issue um yep so that they would they would need to prove it um let's see now the the implications the ramifications of this which honestly I don't I personally don't think that the Silverman versus open AI case has much water I don't think I don't think it's airtight um but if it does proceed this could be a precedent setting uh case and so uh like the like let's assume for the sake of arguments so this is this is something that my lawyer friend told me is if you if you ex like if you just accept it at face value you say let's assume that everything that you're accused of is actually true is it still going to stand so here's here's another way that that lawsuits can get thrown out is like okay like for the sake of argument let's assume that all allegations are true or the that are factually accurate it still is not a violation of the law because here's the thing they didn't provide any evidence that chat GPT will regurgitate Sarah Silverman's work and so then it's like okay if if it's only talking about it and in the slight you know vaguely similar tone that's not a violation of her copyright and if if also if she can't provide any evidence that she's had Financial loss from it so there's there's no Financial loss so that that's not an injury so then the case basically hinges on um infringing her rights um but again like it didn't ingest it if it didn't actually take it then like I don't know I I personally don't see it holding up in court but again I am not a lawyer this is not legal advice this is just my uneducated opinion um on the on the thing now that being said because generative AI is a new technology um uh Claude accurately point out courts may have to devise new tests for determining if AI outputs infringe derivatives based on copyrighted training data existing legal tests may not apply neatly so this is that that's why I mean that this might be a precedent setting case because if they do if it doesn't get thrown out just outright then the courts are going to have to argue and come up with a new test to say okay yes you can write something in the alleged voice of Sarah Silverman and you can talk about her book and you know you know like the tone and style and everything does that constitute an IP violation and that will that could have far-ranging ramifications because then it's like okay you know make me an image in the style of you know Botticelli or whatever um then if this if that doesn't stand then just cloning the style of someone because the AI model has learned to imitate the style from someone even if it hasn't seen their work just by looking at descriptions of it looking at similar things then we could see some really really uh interesting uh legal Fallout from this um another thing is there may be Ripple effects establishing rights around other kinds of data usage like plagiarism detection Services scanning student essays you might have seen in the news recently that all the AI detectors are freaking garbage there was one AI detector that like basically threw out every student essay that was written by non-native English speaker so it's like Yay algorithmic racism like if you're not a native English speaker then like okay we're just going to accuse you of plagiarism and it's it's like that's that's not fair um so we need we need to be careful about that that is not an issue here as far as I can tell in the Silverman case but uh yeah all right so the next one is the big class action lawsuit so here's the interesting thing is this is 352 kilobytes um and I was able to and because I was able to get uh get it down to uh what 360 000 characters Claude is able to read the whole thing all in one go um so this is really these tools are going to really accelerate uh lots of stuff because this is 157 pages of text that it's able to read all at once and so I said okay can you tell me the main causes of action in this complaint in other words what are the main allegations so we already kind of went over that um but like negligent the negligence and the development and release of AI products without sufficient testing or safeguards unjust enrichment deceptive practices and lack of transparency violation of privacy rights um so again some of it this one is primarily about privacy rights rather than copyright uh infringement um and so then it's like you know biometric privacy laws privacy privacy privacy and uh so then you know does it cite evidence it references expert opinions such as Jeff Hinton multiple consumer surveys shutting showing expectations of privacy and lack of consent uh ftc's recent settlement with Amazon regarding Alexa uh California and federal laws like parental consent so one of the one of the things in this in the uh class action version versus open AI is that children have been able to use it and sign up and that then that openai didn't do their due diligence to prevent children from using the tool but again like even if you accept that as true is that actually a legitimate complaint I don't know um but it's like you know children can you know order stuff on Amazon just by borrowing their parents phone so I don't know uh it alleges specific data sources like Reddit that were supposedly scraped without permission based on public comments uh Reddit and Twitter those you know they there's been quite a lot going around on with Reddit and Twitter and public data uh or whether or not the data is public um alleged alleges instances of data usage violations like Snapchat denying the use of location data the chat GPT then revealed it was accessing so that's interesting um it references open ai's own acknowledgments regarding unpredictability of AI systems it cites multiple examples of AI harms like defamatory content to establish the risks so then I asked what are the primary injuries like what is it that they're actually complaining about that that there's that they want uh you know relief from so loss of control over their private data so again privacy loss of autonomy and parental control uh for data collected from miners that could be bad a violation of privacy rights and lack of transparency uh exposure to privacy security and other risks such as emotional risk inability to effectively opt out or have their data deleted which uh open AI already fixed that because of Italy complaining about chat GPT actually so thank you Italy for complaining about Chad GPT and enforcing gdpr compliance and then finally loss of economic value of their data which defendants profited from without compensation to users so basically they're saying that like okay the data that you scraped uh has value and you're profiting from the data that was ill-gotten is my reading of that uh okay cool and then I asked about from a civil procedure standpoint like what is the venue uh what is the subject matter jurisdiction uh the parties class action claims relief sought um it's all that's all pretty straightforward but really the core thing at issue here is privacy rights um and and then open ai's Duty um and due diligence and then finally the FTC com uh it's not a complaint it's an investigation um the FTC investigation uh is just you know like did they make false and misleading claims about its products capabilities um the FTC is concerned about open ai's model it might improperly reveal personal information and remember there have been those leaks right where chat GPT like would suddenly give you information from someone else's chats which that's a really weird thing I'm not sure how that happened because like like seriously guys internal data governance data controls how do you cross-pollinate uh user chats especially when you've got them all identified with uuids that's why you use you IDs is because they're universally unique identifiers if it's not the right uuid don't share that with someone else um let's see FTC is concerned with open ai's models oh wait no I already read that one um FTC wants info on open ai's data collection storage and used practices including what user data is collected and retained and how users can access delete or opt out of data collection which of course they fix that um it seeks info on opening eyes model training including data sources and reviewing and filtering of training data so again at issue for for all of these complaints is what data goes into the model training um you know is it copyrighted is it is it uh you know is it private data and then what do they well how do they protect and safeguard that data security practices and data breaches oversight of third-party services built on its API so this is you know the all their safety constraints and that sort of stuff there's all kinds of stuff um it's it's a comprehensive investigation it's very wide-ranging um it doesn't cite anything specific although I don't necessarily agree with that because it does cite some some of the events from uh from openai for instance that that case of chat GPT leaking um leaking uh uh conversations um let's see can you describe the investigator investigate investigatory Authority that FTC has in this case um yep so they can uh seek information reasonably relevant um now here's here's something that's interesting and this is again according to Claude not an expert but uh the FTC is more concerned about operations and procedures rather than the data itself and so uh while while they do want to understand like um you know basically how it how it trains its models and where it gets its data they're more concerned about how that data is then used is it a violation of privacy and what lengths they go to to ensure that they are playing above board because again as a regulator they're not they're not saying like oh you hurt someone they're this is a more proactive thing so FDC cannot violate attorney-client privilege FTC is supposed to minimize burdens on the company by negotiating scope of requests open AI could raise undue burden concerns um about producing uh enormous data sets and they can they can also open AI can petition to set aside or modified any of the requests so basically it's going to be a negotiation between openai and the FTC and if they need to they might get a a judge involved but honestly just because the FTC is a federal agency I suspect they're probably going to negotiate directly again completely uneducated I don't know if that's actually how how it proceeds um yep so uh and then I I verified my my understanding that it's more about procedures um they so yes the document seeks uh policies processes assessments reports and aggregate consumer complaints rather than raw data so the FTC is probably not going to be looking like combing through the training data or the user data but they do want to see okay what do you do with this and having been through sarbanes-oxley audits before which is more about financial compliance I will say that yeah like if an auditor they don't really they're not going to look at the emails they just want to know like is your email server secure what are you doing to investigate spam and phishing stuff so it's more of a process and procedure kind of thing and then finally it uh oh I asked about like okay if the FTC finds uh like finds fault what can they do so civil penalties the FTC can find them they can do injunctions which basically says like um stop saying that you're not allowed to say it that way uh like if like basically if the FTC concludes that openai did misrepresent their security practices or the model capabilities or the training stuff they might say you know hey you you're not allowed to say that uh because we have deemed that that is factually incorrect and we disagree with that characterization uh some corrective actions and this is what I think is honestly going to be most likely is that basically if the FTC says that like hey you're not handling data and privacy correctly you need to go fix that so rather than finding them they might just say like hey you need to do better now with that being said given how open AI has quickly uh kind of shaped up whenever there's been a problem I think that they're gonna I I personally think that open AI is going to have a good enough uh case that they have done their due diligence and they have made good faith efforts um in order to uh you know abide by their Duty um at least at least in some cases not in all cases but at least when it comes to like data breaches and stuff because the FDC understands that data breaches happen and that and that you might accidentally mishandle data but as long as you have uh proper internal investigation procedures and that you have uh you know done done your due diligence um it might be able to uh kind of toss it and so here it's like okay uh it's entirely possible that the FTC finishes its investigation and concludes opening I did not violate any laws um so like that that is a completely legitimate outcome um you know if if here's another thing if opening eye can demonstrate that it made good faith efforts uh to comply with laws and norms and addresses any problems that it arose FTC would likely pursue collaborative remedies rather than punitive measures so basically this is going to be a learning um opportunity for both sides because open AI is a small company and it was it started as a research company and now it's for-profit and for anyone who has interacted with open AI versus Microsoft versus Nvidia versus IBM open AI has not been the best vendor because they they had to make that hard pivot from being a research organization to a for-profit organization and I know they're technically a cap profit organization but whatever um the fact of the matter is they went from Pure research to now they are a commercial entity and so part of that is they needed to hire the right people to understand how to run their I.T infrastructure correctly how how to design their software architectures to protect uh privacy and that sort of stuff now the the fundamental question here is good faith versus gross negligence did open AI um always act in good faith and and with above-board intentions even if they made mistakes or did they uh really drop the ball or did they willfully or deliberately um kind of skirt Norms or whatever that's really kind of what the FTC is going to be looking for here is uh you know and again I suspect there probably has been honest mistakes and open AI has demonstrated plenty of energy in my opinion to correct some of those honest mistakes but then the the depth of this investigation if there is any negligent wrongdoing I think the FTC is going to find it now the most interesting thing that I think is going to happen is that all three of these investigations are uh are happening at the same time and so the Precedence set by whatever the FTC finds could lend Credence or take the wind out of the sales of these other ones um but these kinds of class action uh complaints and these kinds of FDC investigations take months and months and months and I suspect they're probably all going to go away quietly um they're probably going to settle uh if if there is any kind of legitimacy to it but according to my lawyer friend like uh just on the defense side you're looking at months and months worth of Investigation to um to you know pull together documents to do the investigation to go back and forth with the courts so we're not probably going to see any movement on any of this anytime soon but the fact that it's like we've got this uh you know this rhyming triplet of complaints that are very similar and have some overlap between them is really interesting I'm not personally gonna you know say like open AI is about to implode like that's not gonna happen this is just ordinary um as far as I can tell having watched everything from the red hat and Microsoft uh Anti-Trust lawsuits back in the late 90s early 2000s whenever it was that they finished um this is pretty much run-of-the-mill again success breeds litigation the more successful you are the bigger of a Target you have on your back um now uh what I will say is while I am not the biggest fan of some of the decisions that openai has made I agree with much of what Sam Altman says and I think that he uh means well I think he has good intentions um even if I disagree on execution sometimes and so I think that I think that he will probably lead open AI to say like yeah like let's cooperate with the FTC to make sure that we are compliant um let's let's demonstrate that we did did right by our our customers and our training data now it remains to be seen some of this stuff will probably not even come out in Discovery again because uh open AI as far as I know has rights to protect their Trade Secrets which means that they can ask to say hey let's exclude this from the data set let's keep it off the Record let's keep it off the filings that sort of thing time will tell uh but yes so thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this um also just taking a step back recognizing that like hey I just put like three lawsuits or investigations rather into Claude and one of them was 157 pages long and I had a brief conversation to make sure that I understand it like this is incredible um this is this is a really Next Level technology and we're only seeing the beginning of it because again Claude is a hundred thousand tokens but the Microsoft longnet paper just came out with a billion tokens so imagine that instead of reading just one class action lawsuit you can read literally every class action lawsuit in the entire history of the planet that's what a billion tokens will allow you to do maybe maybe not quite every single class action lawsuit but certainly you could read a lot and that is part of the part of the the difficulty of uh of either filing these class action lawsuits or defending against them is that you have to look for so much precedent um anyways I'm starting to ramble so thanks for watching cheers
