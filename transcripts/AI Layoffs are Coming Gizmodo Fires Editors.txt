just a few days ago Gizmodo laid off their Spanish-speaking editorial staff in favor of AI translators this news comes hot on the heels of just a few months ago Gizmodo and others announced that they were doing a trial run of artificial intelligence generated content it has played out exactly as many of us feared so let me just read a couple of quotations to you so first from the most recent article Gizmodo owner go media shut down and laid off editors of it Spanish language site Gizmodo in espanol and is now using AI to translate articles and then from back in June they talked about this AI trial that they were going to launch they said this uh the trial will include producing just a handful of stories for most of our sites that are basically built around lists and data these features aren't replacing work currently being done by writers and editors and we hope that over time if we get these forms of content right and produced at scale AI will via search and promotion help us grow our audience so they said that it wouldn't replace writers and editors that turned out to be not entirely accurate now obviously it is still a uh work in motion so we will see how it plays out in the long run so here's some analysis here's some things that uh I want you to know so that you can be better equipped to interpret this news and make sense of the world as it changes the first concept I want you to know is jobs dislocation so jobs dislocation is the formal economic term for what we are seeing today uh we we have seen it numerous times throughout history for instance the collapse of the Rust Belt here in America when Auto industry manufacturing jobs started going overseas and getting displaced elsewhere so this is basically the process of job destruction often with the uh at the expense of jobs being created elsewhere in the world such as China India Taiwan so on and so forth now what this means is that it this is a deliberate effect of globalism and neoliberalism wherein the idea is we will find better economic efficiencies by sending as much labor as possible to cheaper job markets economic compaction so you've probably heard class Warfare and the destruction of middle of the middle class those are of course hyperbolic uh and political rhetoric versions of this uh phenomenon called economic compaction so economic compaction is the aggregate effect of things like Rising income inequality uh wage stagnation Global uh globalization increased cost of living basically uh everyone is getting squeezed you know they say the middle class is being squeezed this is called economic compaction and it is comprised of these several forces uh it is also uh characterized by a lack of opportunities all the jobs are taken all the good jobs are taken uh and new good jobs are not being created now we are already at a at a point of I'm not going to say Peak the the terminal condition of globalism because there's still plenty of Labor markets but AI is going to subvert all lab Global labor markets because AI is simply going to be cheaper than all human labor so the economic compaction created by artificial intelligence and automation is going to be something hitherto unseen downward pressure so downward pressure is uh capitalism and free market forces operating as intended the idea is that competition between the providers of goods and services AKA businesses leads them it forces them to seek efficiency gains basically they have to undercut the competition by learning to be more efficient and providing goods and services cheaper this is done through cost cutting measures such as Outsourcing and automation finding other efficiencies but on the bad side the flip side of this is it creates a race to the bottom which means that if your competition compromises their morals ethics and quality you have to as well otherwise you are no longer economically competitive unless your brand says that you are a higher quality and people will just pay more for the sake of uh having that quality uh now the long-term effect the terminal effect is thinning margins so if everyone across the entire world engages in downward pressure and cost cutting measures and this race to the bottom eventually the margins are going to be so thin that the companies are no longer sustainable and they are just not profitable so we are we are approaching this terminal race condition this downward death spiral uh of companies that are going to be competing with each other um and they're going to be trying to out compete Ai and I think I suspect that we're going to see a lot of companies and a lot of sectors just completely implode in the long run which means that the current models of capitalism and neoliberalism will simply stop functioning eventually job creation so the myth of job creation technology does not create new jobs technology lowers the cost of goods and Services which allows for Capital reallocation now this Capital reallocation often creates new jobs uh because of new sectors new demands for uh different kinds of goods and services uh now that being said uh it we should not expect this to happen uh in the future indefinitely just because it has happened in the past past performance is not an indicator of future performance we need to stay wary of unemployment levels which fortunately right now they are still low which means we have time to adapt but this is why I'm doing the work that I'm doing because eventually that time will likely run out I hope that I'm wrong I might be wrong but we need to prepare for all eventualities and it is about a for the foreseeable future it's about striking that balance between job creation and job destruction but in the long run I think that humans simply just cannot compete with the machines and this leads to my final Point social contract the current social contract is that the government mediates the relationship between business and labor however Labor's power is diminishing if you just don't need human labor at all human labor has no power this is due to uh technological disruption again Ai and automation we will need to update our policy and our social contract accordingly no one is talking about this and this scares the actual hell out of me we need to be talking about uh renegotiating the social contract where the government is no longer mediating the relationship between business and labor but between business and all citizens okay vote accordingly thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this cheers
