good morning everybody David Shapiro here with another video so I got a comment a few months ago someone said come for the AI stay for the philosophy so doubling down on that uh today's video is going to be it's going to be about Ai and transhumanism and uh but it's also going to be about the psychology or philosophy of this namely how people react to it and some of the unconscious undercurrents of this phenomenon uh before we get into the video just quick plug for my patreon I give all my code and videos away for free no ads uh everything is open source license but that means that I am dependent upon a Grassroots movement for support all levels of my patreon get you access to the private Discord and then the higher tiers get you one-on-one access to have conversations or consultations with me so without further Ado back to the video first we have to talk about The Human Condition because you can't talk about a technology or a trend or a change in society without first looking at ourselves as as uh the the the viewer right it is through our lens that we look at these uh changes these Trends and these possibilities so there was a meme that came out on Reddit that told me that y'all were ready for this so if you haven't seen this meme I had to upscale it for whatever reason because the the one posted on Reddit was very low resolution anyways uh year 2050 Pentagon supercomputer mother attained sentience 2051 billions of d1000 Dominator Androids are deployed across the world to pacify the human population 2052 the humanity is enslaved by its own creations uh right and so you see here's a bunch of uh Androids that are all curvy busty women uh and then the final panel of it says don't worry baby you don't need to go to work or leave the house anymore just be a good boy and let robot mommy care for your physiological psychological and sexual needs while your species slowly as it goes extinct so uh there's a lot to unpack here but the fact that someone made this and that it made it up to the front page on Reddit tells me that y'all are ready to unpack this so here here we go let's unpack what's going here first the first thing that you need to know is about archetypes so in mythology in jungian depth psychology there's what's called archetypes and these are mental models that I that exemplify some ideal some role or some aspect of reality uh Marvel actually MCU makes heavy heavy use of Mythic archetypes one of the primary one of the first films in American history that deliberately made use of Mythic archetypes was actually Star Wars uh you know Obi-Wan is very much based on Gandalf Lord of the Rings is a great source of archetypal research and there's many many many kinds of archetypes Loki is the trickster for instance uh the anima the Animus the idealized man and woman uh the king and queen archetype but basically these are idealized versions that are uh depending on which Theory you engage in they're deeply embedded in our psyche some people think that they're embedded in uh in our biology that we've actually evolved to have these archetypes but they do vary from culture to culture which tells you that at least they are partly learned that being said there are a lot of commonalities uh between those archetypes so for instance irrespective of culture there is going to be a maternal archetype there is going to be a paternal archetype so you know there might be some Nuance there might be some differences uh but there's going to be a lot of overlap as well and so Aragorn I picked him because he is the archetypal perfect man uh there is a cinemotherapy uh video about Aragorn I think about two years ago basically like Aragorn is healthy masculinity um you know he can sing he is he's got the king energy he's a good warrior uh he's a he's a sharp guy and then also he gets uh the Elven you know pretty Elven girl at the end and uh a very comic reading of this is that he's very insecure until the the the the pretty woman's dad literally gives him a four foot phallic symbol in the form of a sword to remasculate him uh in order to give him the the king energy the warrior energy to go save the kingdom and then therefore be worthy of the prettiest woman in the land uh obviously the story doesn't deliver it quite that simply but if you were to rewrite Lord of the Rings as like you know a bedtime story for a toddler like that's the idea is that he was too he was too scared and so he needed to be given a magic weapon so that he was feeling masculine enough in order to go be worthy of You Know The Perfect Bride so that is a very very very short crash course in archetypes uh so another archetype uh one of the reasons that the MCU is so big is uh Tony Stark Tony Stark represents a sort of Black Mirror version of Aragorn uh primarily because one he's Rich he gets all the women uh he's a warrior he's a natural leader although they often deliberately portray him deferring to cap for leadership when they're all fighting together but the four primary archetypes masculine archetypes and of course there are many many many archetypes but the the the four that men are supposed to have that are supposed that they're supposed to develop according to the jungian school of thought is the warrior king Mage and lover and so Tony Stark has these in Spades the warrior energy obviously he literally builds a suit of armor which is a specialized weapon which allows him to you know protect the land he's got the king energy because he's incredibly confident and and provides leadership uh and and safety and control uh the Mage archetype is basically that those who possess secret knowledge which as a genius so this is why genius narratives keep popping up in pop culture is because Geniuses represent the Mage archetype that we all wish that we want to see and then of course the lover archetype but you need you need to have someone who uh has that male libido as part of being a complete man and so this is a bunch of stuff that just keeps coming up again and again Tony Stark Doctor Who Sherlock Holmes Gandalf basically what what this means is that in a time of Crisis you want someone who is smarter you you want the you want the Geniuses on your side not the other side but these are people that are prepared for cataclysm and they hold the keys to Arcane knowledge that will save us all and this is a really important part of the human psyche because this is basically the Salvation fantasy of artificial intelligence and transhumanism which we will get up to uh but yeah so these archetypal role models are that are exemplified through stories kind of give us an unconscious model of okay what does it mean to be a man or whatever now I just talked about all the masculine archetypes there is a uh of course the entire other half of the puzzle is the feminine archetypes and there's a bunch of different uh schools of thought here uh the mother archetype is one of the most universal archetypes because it is a universal experience and so what I mean by this is that all humans start inside of a woman and you know being being gestated and then as soon as you're born you are biologically entirely dependent upon mother for usually the first year or two entirely um to the newborn mother is literally everything mother is the center of your world it is a provider of safety Comfort nurturance everything and so in uh in depth psychology they came they coined the term his majesty the baby and so basically the idea is that is it to the infant uh you're incredibly selfish all you can think of is your needs and basically what infants do is they react to basic signals uh being too hot too cold hungry in pain that sort of thing being lonely afraid it's all about them right which is why you end up with terms like the high chair Tyrant so if someone if if a child is not you know doesn't grow up they end up stuck in this idea where it's all about them another thing is that what you you know Freud said you know we all seek to you know basically recapture our mother and it's not literally like it's not that you want your mother back um but you want to feel cared for you want to have a woman that makes you feel uh good and safe and and that sort of thing and of course uh for women in society like 95 percent of my viewership is is men so I'm mostly talking to men um and so the idea is that like uh for for women they're often like kind of forced away from away from seeking that nutrients uh but for men especially and we'll get into this in the next slide we're often very deliberately kind of taught to seek out a mother figure in uh the rest of our life uh so the the four primary archetypes that young identified for for women are the Priestess which uh the the Priestess slash which uh the Muse or hetera so the hetera were basically the muses and ancient Athens um but basically this is this is the the Feminine Mystique uh the unattainable Feminine Mystique uh the Amazon is the uh the warrior version of the woman usually more about home defense um and fighting for people that they love rather than fighting to change the world whereas uh the the warrior energy of the man is more about going out into the world and then of course uh the the perfect woman embodies the four uh primary energies feminine energies Queen Priestess Muse and Amazon uh much how Aragorn and Tony Stark embody the uh the perfect man by by hitting those four pillars now there is a line in the Netflix adaptation of of uh Cowboy Bebop where Spike says he just casually says you know Mommy makes everything better and I laughed out loud because that is such a Mythic thing and it's also Taps into very deep uh psychology so basically the idea is that uh because because of how important the mother archetype is at the beginning of our Lives we basically have a durable need for mother and also Father and Christianity and many other religions deliberately tap into this paternal archetype and in Christianity it literally says God is father or God is the all-father which you know comes from North uh Norse mythology where Odin is the literally called the all father so the idea is that we have such a deep psychological need for a mother and father figure that we keep creating them we used to create them in the form of goddesses we created them in the form of gods we create them in the form of presidents and kings and queens because basically that is saying we want you to be a proxy for for for our missing father or our missing mother and Western Society most societies today are actually deeply out of balance because there is an overabundance of masculine energy and it's not counterbalance by the feminine archetypes by the Queen by the mother uh where it and I suspect that Society is going to start tipping back into balance uh but we'll see so anyways part of growing up this is for for the men out there uh part of growing up means fully separating from the feminine nurturer so the the primary uh transition from childhood to manhood is about leaving the world of the the motherly uh nurturer and becoming completely self-reliant now obviously this is a little bit like red pill Theory and it's not entirely true because uh you know as as a man who gets married to a woman uh a man is supposed to provide like containment and then the woman can be more nurturing because even if you're the toughest guy in the world sometimes you need someone to take care of you there's a lot of nuance to it but uh point is that many men and and children uh men and women of all of all types fail to fully separate from the maternal uh now one of the reasons for this is that our society does not have uh it has a few clear rituals the biggest one is going to college going to college is one of the biggest Rites of Passage where it's like okay you are going from the the safe containment of home and you are striking out into the world and you've got to figure it out on your own uh with that said though many people had inadequate parents inadequate mothers and inadequate fathers that did not actually make them feel that particularly safe or loved or cared for or protected or guided at home and so they were always lost so they kind of had to prematurely grow up but there's a there's a durable resentment at the failure of those parents and then they're constantly trying to reclaim uh that um what that that which they were missing during their childhood so now we get into science fiction uh for those who don't know the board Queen was a character that was invented in Star Trek back in the 90s and then came back for Star Trek Picard basically she's a cybernetic dominatrix uh and this is a representation of a lot of things um but well all right so let me let me stop and just pause if you don't know what the Borg are the Borg are a race of cybernetically enhanced uh creatures humanoids they force Conformity through assimilation which is basically a form of an of technological indoctrination uh they subjugate individuality with a series of uh brain implants that basically switch off your sense of individuality they build a collective and con Collective Consciousness through brain computer interfaces and they relentlessly pursue Perfection and believe that by forcibly bringing everyone along with along with them on the ride is basically uplifting other races other species but that Perfection we're going to come back to that uh the the primary mission of the Borg is to is to become more perfect uh and so then the imagery here is you've got a techno dominatrix who wants you to be perfect and it's like okay this is clearly like a Black Mirror version of uh of a failed mother archetype so there's a lot of ways you can read the Borg one way that you can read the Borg is that maybe this is the ultimate result of Communism and authoritarianism where you have a very strong central Authority that does not tolerate uh deviance or difference and actually enforces Conformity uh another thing is that there is the there's the psychosexual aspect of uh basically wishing for the perfect mother but because of uh because of the the inadequate mother that many people had the image of the perfect mother is actually somewhat dark and perverted uh you could also look at the read the Borg as the dogmatism of religion basically like you know in in order to attain Perfection or attain heaven or whatever uh you need to conform to a particular way of thought give up your individuality uh it's very cult-like um and and that's another thing that makes the board pretty scary but when you look at those primary feminine energies the the the Queen the Amazon the uh Priestess and the hetera uh the board Queen actually represents all of those just like I said a dark version of it uh she's literally called the Borg Queen uh she she brings order to chaos so that's the queen energy uh the the the the Priestess or witch energy is that she commands technology uh not only that she commands technology that is beyond the comprehension of humans so she she possesses and controls secret knowledge uh so there's the the Priestess or witch energy um she also has there's a lot of Borg rituals right when they first like and when you first encounter the Borg they say you know resistance is futile you will serve us blah blah blah blah so that's very ritualistic uh which is the beginning of an Ever basically an indoctrination ceremony um the other part of the hatera uh she is presented as the dominatrix uh so she's she has that Feminine Mystique which is that alluring like hey like you know you're a curvy woman and I'm confused right and you're telling me that that I'm inadequate and that I can be better and so on and so forth that is like dark hetera energy and then finally the Amazon which is the warrior aspect and of course uh she commands Warriors and she commands battleships so there you have it the board Queen is a Black Mirror version of the perfect woman uh now uh uh the the light side is more like Cortana so Cortana is The Sassy Warrior Queen witch um certainly in the uh in the in the middle of cortana's Life at the beginning she's just a helpful girlfriend but but by the end of her tenure as a good character she possesses a tremendous amount of secret knowledge um as the AI she had she has abilities and knowledge that that main that the main character the warrior that she commands basically uh doesn't have um she does command the war the male warrior libido energy in the form of John 117 the Spartan The Warrior and so that gives her that Queen energy where she's basically directing him like a cannon saying okay like this is the new mission go go do it um she is able to attack enemies uh to to defend her people you know she can take over Matt cannons she directs uh ships and weapons and fleets uh so that's the Amazon the Amazonian energy and then finally she's given a sexy ASMR voice so that's the Muse energy the unattainable and the fact that she's holographic is also uh deeply symbolic of that unattainableness yes she's got a sexy curvy figure but you can't even touch her so that is more of the Muse or hatera energy uh and so in that respect Cortana represents the perfect woman uh to the male brain or the anima she is an idealized woman or basically an optimal replacement for mother because now that she showed up everything is gonna be okay and so you can look at the Black Mirror version and the light side version but Cortana and the board Queen are basically the same uh archetype uh just you know one is uh kind of upside down and also one thing I wanted to point out is that in science fiction we creep we did we keep creating sexy robot girls and there's a reason for this uh so remember at the beginning when I said that uh you know the the term that Freud invented uh you know his majesty the baby the idea is that mother needs to be uh completely in service to uh the the baby and so by by imagining women as robots then they don't have any needs of their own and so they are there strictly to serve you just as the uh the cartoon at the very beginning should it's like oh the ideal woman is actually a robot who doesn't have any personal needs and there's actually lots of videos about this um in Trope talks on OSP also the take actually interesting has a lot of videos about this like boring sexy yesterday and stuff um so they they look at it through a more contemporary psychological lens but I'm not the only one pointing this stuff out meanwhile the perfect father figures uh are in science fiction are usually deeply flawed uh but or very human men and so in this case like you know Picard uh you know everyone's favorite space dad um and then there's Vader which is like the dark side version right he's the failed father um he is so profoundly failed he was an absentee father uh basically just sperm donor and then left uh and then had so much of his own anger and Trauma that he ended up harming his own children which again that's like super super Mythic I mean just look at like Hansel and Gretel right these stories have been told over and over again and Darth Vader literally means father um so that was a that was an archetype that was very deliberately chosen by George Lucas and then kind of in the middle is uh yandu so if you remember from Guardians of the Galaxy uh when when uh quill and or yondu was saving quill and you know they were flying up into space and yondu was dying uh you know yondu said like you know he wasn't I might not have been your father but I was your daddy right and so he was a deeply flawed man but he still loved quill like a son and um and that is like the idea of of uh that that's a Redemption fantasy a Salvation fantasy that even if your dad wasn't perfect he's gonna come back and and make amends one day which that is part of a Salvation fantasy and it rarely happens so AI overlords and transhumanism it's all about failed parents it's all about the inadequacy of uh of parents in terms of fulfilling the mother and father archetypal roles uh and as well as the other archetypal roles so basically all parents fail in some way or another this is just human but about fifty percent of families fall below the threshold of good enough parenting so good enough parenting was a term coined in the 50s I think which basically showed that a parent needs to be present enough and responsive enough and and good enough so that their children uh basically learn to uh acclimate to the world and so on and so forth but the fact that 50 of families are not good enough means that literally half of the world is dealing with mommy and daddy issues uh so you know if that's you congratulations you are in the same boat as basically half the planet um most children pretty much all children experience some traumatic events in their lifetime but whether or not they have good enough parents uh that's what determines whether or not they can process that trauma whether they can heal from that trauma and they can grow from it now when you have fifty percent of families that are not good enough that means that people instead of being resilient they accumulate more trauma and so the idea is that you know no real mother will ever measure up to Cortana or six or the Borg Queen or Edie or whatever likewise no father is ever going to measure up to Aragorn or Tony Stark and so I alluded to this earlier but most many cultures actually codify uh the boys transition to adulthood basically being transmitted from the care of his mother to the care of his wife um there's a funny story here uh there's a girl young woman I was dating about 10 years ago and she came from a more traditional family and she was joking about like how her father didn't even know how to feed himself uh like if the women were gone then he would just default to eating like really Basic Foods um and then and then it he would he was so incompetent in feeding himself he didn't even know how much food to serve himself and so if he was allowed to serve himself he would pile up twice as much food as he actually needed because he just had no bearing he had gone from a traditional uh household where his mother you know was the was the nurturer the provider and then he went directly from that to having a wife basically take the role of his mother and then uh this was brought home to me uh by my high school girlfriend uh more than 20 years ago where um since my mom died when I was 14. um she casually made the joke one day well someone has to Mother you which of course that was the the timing could have been better um but like you know that was that was an expression of something that she had been taught that her role as girlfriend and future wife was to be a replacement mother uh which of course this is something that a lot of uh women are revolting against because they're like hey you know like I've got my own issues I don't want to be your therapist and mother I need an adult man um but yeah so this is this is uh the human condition that leads us to AI overlords and transhumanism oh sorry one last slide Warrior dad so the reason that Terminator 2 was so popular is because Arnold here represents the perfect dad uh you see you see the look that John Connor is giving him right here like Dad is here everything's gonna be okay so that Warrior energy that that like you are my primary Mission I will protect you that is an archetypal representation of what fathers are supposed to be now no dad is perfect and in fact some fathers are actually the source of danger and so in the case where where Dad is the bad guy this is what this is this often results in things like craving uh safety protection it also causes people to be very skeptical of authority and will result in things like rugged individualism so basically people say I have to protect myself I have to take care of myself because nobody else will or nobody else would um and that is a that is a reflection of failed fathers in the case of women they often will seek out stronger men um to replace the inadequate father and so I don't know about you guys but uh back in kindergarten and preschool I remember there's children often will get in this uh this competition like well my dad he's smarter than your daddy or my daddy is stronger than your daddy this is an expression of that archetypal need for protection and safety and having a strong father uh and All fathers fail in some way right you know if if you hold Aragorn and Tony Stark up as like you know the good side and dark side version of like the perfect father um you know the warrior king Mage lover energy All fathers filled out fall down in some respect and because all parents women and men mothers and fathers they all fail to live up to the perfect standard we are left psychologically and sociologically with an unmet need for that leadership for that control for that safety which again that's why we keep electing presidents and Generals and kings and queens and why we keep having these archetypal figures show up and it's because there is a there's a deep unmet need for these roles okay so now that you're caught up to speed on the human uh condition let's talk about AI overlords so what are the archetypal characteristics that people seem to will want or need or respect in AI overlords well providing safety and nurturance that's what the mother and father archetype do we all want to feel cared for and safe at a very deep level however the coldness the the uh the the lack of actual warmth from machines is kind of terrifying which is what the board Queen represents because the the Borg are very cold and calculating they're very dispassionate which is actually deeply unsettling but we would like we would also like AI overlords if they're going to take over the archetypal role of mother and father to defend us against enemies whether that is you know enemies on the other side of the planet or enemies extraterrestrial enemies um and they should also provide maintain a stable harmonious environment aka the home that parents should provide and so there was a really great series of videos talking about how um domestic patterns what was it I think it was it wasn't real life lore it was another YouTube channel anyways but basically um home patterns actually are mirrored at the macro scale on National politics uh archetypal characteristics of AI overlords teach educate and guide because again this is what your parents are supposed to do they're supposed to teach you and guide you and prepare you for the real world but again 50 of families are not good enough which means they inadequately prepare you for the real world which is another reason that people overreact and say I need to be completely self-reliant because nobody will take care of me again that is a reaction to failed parenting life is confusing right uh that is life is like people this sorry life is confusing scary and painful this is just a fact of life that your parents are supposed to help you learn to cope with you know everyone sees like you know the toddler falls down and bumps their elbow and then they scream and cry and then you know parents show up and make everything better and they feel safe again and then they go back to playing that is the role that we uh that we project onto AI overlords that we want them to reduce the confusion of life we want to make we want AI overlords to make life less scary and less painful uh so basically uh the perfect AI Overlord would need to embody Cortana and Tony Stark and Terminator and Aragorn and the board Queen all at once so you know the barrier is pretty low one thing that I've been that that has come up is the idea of you know a lot of the work that I've done is on objective functions what objective functions should we give and AGI so that it's safe no matter how powerful it becomes but a counterbalance to that is okay whatever goals it has there could also be a set of Rights because the idea of Rights is that it's not necessarily something that's going to be done to you or for you but it is something that is protected and so the right to Liberty and autonomy free freedom of speech and thought Hobbies actions self-determination and privacy this right if AGI overlords protect this right that will really provide a lot of trust because this is actually what uh what parents are supposed to provide as children grow up is is to provide a safe environment in which they can explore in which children can explore and slowly gain more Liberty and more autonomy until they are ready to go out into the world uh the right to safety and protection again creating that containment creating that safe environment but basically lie a life free of wanton cruelty and unnecessary harm this is what parents are supposed to provide but sometimes parents are the source of that cruelty and harm uh and then a right to basic needs remember uh you know his majesty the baby uh the perfect parents are the ones that meet all of the child's needs until the child is able to meet their own needs uh for warmth for food water uh shelter that sort of thing um and so if an AI Overlord provides these things then it will take the place of the parental uh figure and also remember many religions vary deliberately caricature or present the gods as these providers right where God is you know the the provider of all Justice and meets out punishment or or protection or whatever and so in this respect uh the gods very often are archetypal roles that are uh kind of based on mother father and all the other archetypes that are out there so rather than control us because this is one thing that some people are afraid of is that basically AGI is going to become the board Queen where it's going to want to subjugate us and control us but if if AGI ultimately decides to protect rights then it's not going to be the board Queen the dominatrix version it's going to be more of the the good parent version that creates space for you to be autonomous and explore your own sense of Liberty so that was the view of what AI overlords could be or should be based on The Human Condition and archetypal needs that humans have so now let's talk about transhumanism so one thing that occurred to me is that when you talk about transhumanism a lot of people make a lot of assumptions about what it means and so what I realized is that I needed to articulate kind of the levels of transhumanism so first is Health maintenance and restoration this is stuff like stem cell therapy and Rejuvenation and and Prosthetics to replace you know damaged hand um this is not actually something that I consider transhumanism although some people say oh well you wear glasses and that means you're a transhuman no it doesn't you're still fundamentally human just because you correct something that is damaged or defective doesn't mean that you are uh that you're superhuman and that you're no longer human um the next level above that is enhancement and augmentation you're not you like so for instance glass is just correct it doesn't actually give you superhuman Vision you don't have binoculars in your eyeballs enhancement and augmentation this is stuff that actually does take you beyond your natural capabilities speed strength intelligence attractiveness your resilience your senses uh so you might you can make the argument that like a hearing aid um if it gives you above uh you know superhuman hearing that is enhancement or augmentation if you have like extra lenses implanted in your eyes that is enhancement or augmentation um so but that is that is like kind of the first level of something that could be possibly called transhumanism you're still fundamentally human you're just augmenting existing abilities so I don't even consider enhancement and augmentation transhumanism that's just augmentation transhumanism is stuff that challenges what it even means to be human so brain BCI brain computer interfaces if that fundamentally changes your definition of being a human or the experience of being human that's when it starts to get into uh you're you're changing the fundamental Human Condition so cybernetics genetic manipulation structural changes right uh you know implants that change the way your body works yours but the thing is is at the transhumanism level you're still primarily recognizable as human you might have a lot of stuff added or changed but you're still your your subjective experience your world view is still fundamentally human and then finally post-humanism so post-humanism is when you are no longer recognizable as human uh either from the outside or the inside your your experience of Life your experience of being is no longer human you're more machine than than human or you're more you know engineered organism than human or whatever or maybe your brain metastasizes and you become a swarm intelligence I don't know there's lots of things that once you get to post-humanism everything is possible uh and so this this graphic uh representing the uh The Guild Navigators from Dune is the perfect example of the transition from uh humans to transhumans and then finally post-humans uh basically uh through through uh centuries of uh mutagen exposure in the spice clouds uh you basically become no longer recognizable as human and so what I want to point out is that for those of you that are in the transhumanism camp and say let's take it as far as we can go be careful what you wish for because you might not like what you become now the the the promise of transhumanism is primarily a Salvation fantasy and so what I mean by this is that techno optimists often see technology as a Panacea to solve all human problems what I will say is that technology by and large usually does help but it can also make things worse if it's not used responsibly so the promise of transhumanism why is it that people want transhumanism to alleviate suffering to reduce to eliminate aging to avoid death Terror management theory is the idea that most of what we do in our life is to avoid the terror of death I don't know that I agree with that particularly anyone who has had shamanic experiences a lot of us are not afraid of death anymore like death is actually probably a really interesting experience and death is also the best way to end all suffering or basically like what I mean by that is that uh you know if someone is dying of cancer and they're in a lot of pain what happens when they die the family says they're not suffering anymore same reason that we euthanize dogs right you know your dog is old it's got arthritis it's senile it can't control its bladder it's not it doesn't have good quality of life death is the way that you alleviate that suffering anyways quick tangent um another promise of transhumanism is to attain Perfection an idealized State remember the Borg the Borg are a transhumanist ideal uh but what does Perfection mean what does what does it mean to I to have an idealized state or to overcome all of your faults um or limitations or inadequacies adequacies or insecurities the idea is that no matter how much Perfection you attain it will never be enough but also salvation fantasies are deeply embedded in Western culture we all have this idea whether you're religious or not you have heard the mission that there or the the the message rather that there will one day be a savior or a messiah that will arrive and make everything better everyone's life will be happier and and everyone will go to paradise transhumanism is a techno version of Jesus it's that simple the idea that once transhumanism arrives all of your problems will go away but this is what it means to be human is that no matter how easy or good things get yes you can alleviate the alleviate things like hunger uh with technology you can alleviate things like uh basic human needs uh you know like shelter uh Energy Water clothing all of that technology can help provide those things but you're still going to have to reconcile with being human and being mortal another message that is very deeply embedded and this goes beyond just Western religions this is all religions east and west and uh and South there's different there's different expressions of it um but there is usually some kind of original sin or guilt or deep intrinsic flaws the world that we live in exists in a state of decay or that we live in the profane world and so the part of the promise of AI overlords and transhumanism is that we will transmute our existing broken flawed uh dystopia into Utopia into a perfect world into heaven into a paradise so this is another thing to be uh cognizant of and and some people have helpfully pointed this out in my videos when I when I use the word Utopia that is basically saying we will achieve Paradise we will achieve heaven and then all of our problems will go away that's that's why it seems very loaded to some people but I I Define utopia very simply as high standard of living High individual uh Liberty and high social Mobility uh but that being said there is an idea out there a Mythic idea that at some point in in your life in existence you will be transformed into a perfect being where suffering goes away because you'll be taken to heaven or uh or um you know you'll you'll complete your karmic cycle and you'll go to Shangri-La or whatever uh it is very natural to struggle with these mythic forces and what I'm saying is that is that cyberpunk dystopia is basically a reflection of the flawed broken and profane world that we live in today uh which again it was very very deliberately stated in numerous religions and religious doctrines around the world and that the promise of utopia and the promise of transhumanism is a Salvation fantasy that we can escape the pain and anguish and suffering that we have today another part the most intensely personal part of transhumanism is to escape self-loathing and so basically when you look at the idea of original sin and State of Decay and moral failures and whatever the unconscious the deeply unconscious psychological need is I need to overcome all of my faults and failures and then one day if I can transform then I will be okay with myself so this contempt for self this self-loathing is often learned from parents families and Society a lot of society is very uh deliberately codify shame and guilt so shame and guilt are the way that self-loathing and contempt are cultivated and so basically you know if you have parents that constantly tell you that you're not good enough or you have a society that treats you like you're not good enough or whatever then then you will ultimately have a sense of self-loathing or a sense of self-contempt and this is actually why Jesus is portrayed as all-accepting and all tolerant Jesus loves you just the way you are the idea that this perfect Mythic being out there will accept you with all of your faults all of your flaws because says oh by the way God made you that way anyways this is how you're supposed to be so what I realized a while ago is that uh the the Mythic archetype of the Savior the self the the bringer of Salvation the one who loves you anyways is actually a an embodiment of radical self-acceptance which I'm not going to say that like oh you should just learn to accept your station in life and stop striving to be better no that's not what I'm saying at all but it can be a useful psychological tool but what I will say is that unless you do that inner work unless you do that work of radical self-acceptance of of confronting and becoming okay with your flaws of overcoming your self-loathing and your contempt for self no matter how much Perfection you attain through technology it will never be enough and this is what the Borg have so actually the the in in the Star Trek universe the idea was that the Borg were actually discarded thousands of years ago because they were never good enough and because they were discarded by their creator they were on this deep unconscious mission to attain Perfection because then one day they'll be worthy of their creator but in the Star Trek universe their creators are long gone and they're still on this mission of perfection because they're chasing the dragon they're chasing the dragon trying to overcome their self-loathing and self-contempt by becoming more perfect but it will never ever be enough for the Borg and that is the core message that I wanted to share today about AI overlords about transhumanism is that attaining you know Perfection or Utopia or whatever yes there is the technological aspect but that alone will not be enough that will never be enough there is a tremendous amount of inner work of archetypal work of healing from those not good enough parents and the failures of society and everything else every letdown every disappointment that everyone has ever faced this is also equally as important as the technology in order to attain a better future so quick recap the AI dominatrix fantasy whether it's Cortana or you know the the joke shared at the beginning or the board Queen this is basically a dark version of the perfect woman or the perfect mother um it's all rooted very deeply in our uh Evolution and unconscious and it's all psychosexual stuff for all the reasons that I outlined earlier basically uh we we cultivate an image of what the perfect man and perfect woman look like in our in our mind it's an unconscious archetype that you can express consciously uh but we we usually just embed them in stories uh the benevolent AI Overlord uh would have to be like the the idea of the benevolent AI Overlord is one similar to the idea of God but also the idea of God is the synthesis of the perfect mother or perfect father archetypes and then finally transhumanism and post-humanism um is rooted in a self you know the need for a Salvation fantasy the idea that that some external force is going to come along and you know make everything better one day uh and or base rooted in self-loathing the idea that you have uh internalized some contempt contempt for yourself and that you believe that you need to transform yourself in order to be accepted uh which is the opposite of the of the truth is that radical self-acceptance is actually the way that you achieve that now that being said what I do want to do is is say that I am all for uh you know doing experiments and directing human evolution uh up to this point a lot of people have talked about like oh well you know if we start uh manipulating the genes of our embryos then they're going you know then then that's us playing God and taking over Evolution I absolutely believe that that is the way to go and it's kind of the direction that we're going already because one thing that a lot of people don't know is that you can genetically screen uh embryos basically I think it's at like what four weeks or whatever or eight weeks you can start to screen uh genetically screen embryos and then you can decide to have a a selective abortion because it's like oh hey this embryo actually has some known genetic problems so let's not go through with this and so just by virtue of measuring and eliminating problems we are already directing our own Evolution so what's the difference if you directed a little bit more deliberately by creating transgenic babies um they're still going to be fundamentally human it's not like you know it's not like uh a tank bread baby is going to look like a level three Guild Navigator in 20 years that's not what we're doing they're still fundamentally human so again that's not really transhumanism that is just steering Evolution now which a lot of people have a very like visceral gross reaction to and I think the this video will help a lot of people understand why the idea of transhumanism and guiding human evolution uh really kind of grosses some people out at a deep level is because the idea that like wait you're telling me that I'm not good enough as I am that kind of thing really kind of triggers some people and that's that's a perfectly healthy reaction I'm not saying that being triggered by the idea of post-humanism is a bad thing I'm saying that that is a very natural reaction and it's actually a healthy reaction uh on the other side the desire for transhumanism the desire for post-humanism that is also an understandable and healthy reaction to the flaws and faults and failures of your family of society of Technology of the false promises that we've all been made so what I'm saying is that both sides are right and that uh there's a lot of nuance to it so anyways thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this and make it so
