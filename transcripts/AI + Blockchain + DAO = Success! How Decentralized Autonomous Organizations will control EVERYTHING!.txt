morning everybody David Shapiro here with a video um so today's video is about decentralized economics uh as in particular with AI blockchain and distributed autonomous organizations now with the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence particularly tools like chat gbt people are starting to understand what's coming and what I mean by that is that more and more people are automating aspects of their job including writing emails reading emails tickets coding all that kind of stuff and so as these agents become more and more autonomous folks are waking up to the fact that eventually and by eventually I mean like later this month probably uh AI is going to be spending more time talking to other AI than it will be talking to humans and in this case trust and security become a major issue there's comments all over the place Twitter Reddit and so on people are like how are we going to trust that anything we read was written by a human the answer is blockchained based Technologies such as distributed autonomous organizations and nfts we're not going to get into nfts to day let me know if you want that as a future topic but basically I think that all human content on the internet will eventually be nfts and so that you'll have a chain of custody of who created it when and what created it uh anyways uh going down that rabbit hole so this meme pretty much illustrates where we're at right now but just take it one step further and imagine that instead of you reading emails your company has an email bot that generates emails that go to all your customers clients and partners and then they have email Bots that read it and business becomes more and more autonomous this is coming I'm uh I have many patreon supporters who are doing this kind of thing they're several startups uh folks that I'm friend with that are working on making autonomous employees basically so it's coming okay so for those of you who don't know what is a blockchain um first what I need to say is that yes Bitcoin is the most famous use of blockchain Technology but it is not the only use of blockchain Technology uh so basically it is a it is a dis decentralized digital Ledger uh kind of technology which a digital Ledger is basically a kind of transactional database where it keeps track of logs that's what it means by ledger so like if you think of like a financial Ledger you're keeping track of financial transactions in this case you're keeping track of digital transactions it is decentralized based on many many nodes and it is uh made to be tamper proof and so what it what I mean by tamper proof is that once a block is added to the chain it cannot be modified but also for a block to be added to the chain the the network has to give consensus and we'll talk a little bit more about consensus in a moment but one of the key things is that one it's peer-to-peer and two it is for a trustless environment so a trustless environment is a cyber security concept where you have no idea who you're talking to everyone is on is anonymous and for us humans we're used to that if you get on Reddit or Twitter and you're interacting with someone who just has gibberish as a username you have no idea who they are um we get that on YouTube some YouTube comments are generated by troll Farms or Bots or whatever and so uh blockchain is a way to engage with digital information in a trustless environment basically where you have no idea who you're talking to or who else is participating and this uh this decentralized trustless peer-to-peer environment is what makes cryptocurrency possible now a whole bunch of other things become possible with blockchain technology so before we go a little bit further I need to talk to you a little bit about consensus so consensus is a method whether it's algorithms or data or other techniques that you can use in order to collectively decide what gets accepted onto the blockchain so it has to do with Collective verification and it has to it also is how you can establish the validity of a particular transaction so there's a few algorithms such as proof of work proof of stake delegated proof of stake so on and so forth so consensus is how the network decides to accept information and in a human Network say for instance on Twitter or Reddit or something what can happen is you see someone post a link right just imagine your typical Twitter thread or Reddit thread someone posts a link someone looks at it and says yeah but look at the source that source is not verifiable and then someone else says oh but look at look at who said this this person is not trustworthy and so the general consensus through natural language it might be that you know a particular post is useful or useless or they might point out that like hey this is a click bait title so therefore it's not accurate so that is a kind of like human consensus algorithm now imagine Opera operationalizing that with an algorithm this is not exactly the way that it works because if you look up the way that proof of work and proof of stake uh work it's not anything like that but what I'm the reason that I'm using this analogy is to show a more familiar uh kind of format as to what consensus looks and feels like now the math side of that is going to be a little bit different but the long story short is that having a consensus mechanism is what mathematically allows you to have that trustless environment now smart contracts so one part of blockchain and decentralized autonomous organizations Dows is that you need smart contracts so a smart contract is a bit of code that is executed automatically um by uh by and on the blockchain technology so this can execute everything from Financial transactions to sending data you can even have compute agreements so say for instance one of the things that's being explored quite extensively especially with large language models is Distributing the layers of those large language models and so a smart contract could be you agree to process this layer of this piece of data and then in exchange you get you know some kind of reward usually cryptocurrency um but basically what this this is this is the this is the net result of a blockchain is some smart contract gets executed based on the consensus algorithm uh and and everything that goes into that at and so what is not immediately obvious is how versatile this is so I was talking with a friend of mine who had been investigating a fraud case that had to do with Supply chains and stuff and I said imagine how much easier this investigation would have been if every single change order and pull request and check had been on a blockchain and he's like holy crap you're right so and and because the the reason that that is disruptive is because in order for uh in order for a transaction to be added to a blockchain it has to be verified by all the nodes so in in the cases of like fraud and embezzlement one person one stakeholder with the right email address and connections can make a phone call or send a text message to redirect you know goods or services from one company to another or from one account to another without permission but if that company or that government organization uses a blockchain or a dow technology in order to control everything then most of the nodes will need to agree yes this is a legitimate transaction and if they reject it they'll say no this is obviously fraudulent or you know a mistake or something like that and by having that that that chain of custody of change requests and all that kind of stuff you can really Tamp down on mishandling and misappropriation of resources and that's just a supply chain example um VMware is a company that I used to work with a lot that was my favorite technology back when I was in a systems engineer they're working on their own blockchain uh thing and one of the key uh E-Business cases is supply chain so that's that's a one example another example is stock market trades so whether you're talking about options uh day trading that sort of stuff those kinds of things can be executed with smart contracts as well also if my voice sounds a little bit hoarse it's because it's still allergy season we're at like 8.1 out of 10 yesterday in my local area for the allergens so I'm a little bit raspy um okay so finally we're building up to what is a dow so you take these underlying Technologies uh blockchain consensus mechanisms and smart contracts and what you do is then you create a set of rules basically it can be a corporation kind of thing it can be a government kind of thing it can be a neighborhood but you put all of that control into an autonomous organization that uses blockchain that uses consensus and uses smart contracts in order to uh control resources and so this creates an algorithmic framework to allocate resources to make decisions and so on and so forth and so this brings that trustless aspect into human collaboration basically now we're going to take this one step further in just a second and but what I want to say before we move on is you've probably heard some horror stories about Dows there's this phenomenon called the rug pull where there's a lot of grifters out there saying oh invest in this Dow it's going to give you 10 there are pretty much all Ponzi schemes Dows are not an investment vehicle Dows are a resource management vehicle so if someone just asks you to put money into a dow that's not what they're for now if you are part of a corporation and you say hey we're going to use a dow to replace the board of directors or to uh you know replace this layer of management that might make a little bit more sense if you're in a neighborhood and you want to replace your HOA and run it with a dow instead that makes more sense because you're a stakeholder with you know enforceable rights to a thing but if you're just investing in a dow the technology is not mature enough for that yet so my uh this is not Financial advice obviously do your own research but what I will say is I would never personally invest in a dow that are not investment vehicles um Okay so with all that groundwork laid and I know that I've been going pretty fast and I'm not reading you know the description word for word you can pause the video and look at that if you'd like What If instead of just human stakeholders you have humans and AI participating in a dow so this to me seems like what the Dow was actually invented for uh and so by by saying that hey you know because AI like a language model has no idea what it is or who you are or anything like that but a language model can help you write contracts can help participate with sharing information so on and so forth so then if the rest of the network approves the information coming from that autonomous agent or semi-autonomous agent and then there's humans also in the loop it seems to me that a that the combination of blockchain distributed autonomous organizations and AI is probably the way to go and this can be used for uh private organizations so for instance corporations can use this so that no matter how many autonomous agents are spun up uh they all have to approve of what's going on in their collaboration space Um this can do this can be used for a few things one processing information so just putting information on your Dow such as like emails corporate records whatever and using that information like I mentioned a minute ago supply chain records great example but you can also use the Dow to autonomously distribute tasks work items so for instance if you have a factory floor uh that needs to be managed or if you have a larger multinational logistics thing that needs to that needs to to uh be organized or managed uh Dows are a possible way of doing that and we're going to get into some very specific examples here in just a minute uh before I move on with the rest of the video I do want to plug my patreon real quick so um my patreon has been evolving I've simplified the tiers especially since I moved most not most but much of the conversation off to Discord which has really driven engagement my private patreon Discord is great um some of my favorite channels are the off topic and the existential coping channels um where mostly we talk about goats apparently um but yeah so jump in um my higher tiers are all sold out right now because there's a few reasons but basically I don't have enough time to get to everyone so those are capped but later in May once I come back um I will probably raise those caps a little bit because I actually do get a lot out of talking with um with patreons so most of the people who sign up for the higher tiers are um they are usually small businesses small and medium businesses who just need a little bit of expert guidance on how to implement some like AI Vector search that kind of stuff I do brainstorming sessions um you know like someone will come to me with a particular idea or a problem and I'll help them talk through it um we address all kinds of stuff from legal cases to Insurance Mental Health all kinds of stuff that I that I'll talk with the companies about and of course the liability is with them I just provide you know my perspective and expertise um as is so moving right along I mentioned that uh that you know I was going to give some specific use cases for dowels and I think that this will help it make the most sense so what we're going to do is we're gonna we're gonna go on it on a user Journey so to speak where we're going to start with personal use what could you use a dow for personally then we'll go up to Smart Homes or family use cases Enterprise corporate uh use cases communities such as neighborhoods federal agencies and then finally we'll get to Global governance okay so for a personal dial imagine that you have you know we all have electronic devices and electronic accounts all over the place right you've got social media you've got your news feeds you've got your phone you've got your smart home devices you've got your car so imagine what happens when you have multiple AI agents running everywhere but you want that information to be secure a personal area Dao is probably a good place to put that right because imagine that you're smart your your smartphone has an AI agent an autonomous AI agent it's running on your phone all the time it's got some Cloud connection stuff like it might back up its data to the cloud but you want your phone talking to your home and your TV and your car but you need it to be secure and autonomous and private so a personal level Dow would be a good way to achieve that so why what are the like what are the outcomes obviously privacy and security are are some of the primary concern irons but then imagine all the benefits that you get from just using like chat GPT today like hey like what's my wife up to can you send her a text message real quick and then you know your AI Dao can say okay like let's talk to her send some message to her Dao and so on and so forth one of my um I don't want to like undercut anyone um but one of my I had a really interesting conversation with actually a few people um on Discord and and on patreon where people are working on that kind of stuff um and so like this is this is where I get some of these ideas um but like imagine that your that your AI Dow keeps track of this kind of stuff that you do right so instead of instead of Google knowing everything that you do your personal AI Dell has your records of where you go what you do how you feel on a day-to-day basis like even imagine that your Fitbit is like part of your AI Dao so then it's all your data is self-contained it's not owned by a corporation out there somewhere it is owned by you but then you have multiple possibly even dozens or even hundreds of AI agents using that data to help you live better so that is one example of where a dow could be used for a personal level and this is this is relatively near term this is something like I said that that I know of people who are working on setting up this kind of thing today okay so take that one step further you have your personal area Dao your wife or boyfriend or partner or kids or parents or whatever they also have their personal area down these are also connected to your smart home devices as shared resources so say for instance your um your kitchen gets more automated and so the the automated kitchen is a shared resource that your personal Dao is forms a hierarchy with so it or maybe maybe hierarchy is not the right word maybe a federation so in technology a federation is independent nodes that form like bilateral alliances which I mean that's really just what a federation is um so imagine that your personal dial forms a federation with your home Dow and your home Dow also has a federation with your kids your partner any trusted friends that are allowed to come over so it keeps track of your identities which can help with home security but it also keeps track of dietary needs and health needs and so then like your fridge will be like hey you know it's five o'clock maybe like let's make some stir fry because that's your favorite thing to eat on Wednesdays or whatever that sort of stuff it can also work with your children to uh form uh to formally keep track of their education and their tutoring and and their and their information needs also their entertainment right uh if you once we get to a little bit more sophisticated robot home robots than roombas maybe they can even like replace your air filters and and water filters and stuff like that uh so by creating these bilateral federations of dows uh that again because Dallas are meant to be in a trustless environment but you establish those relationships where there can at least be bilateral communication then your personal Dao which is just an array of AI agents autonomous and semi-autonomous AI agents whose primary job is your health and well-being can then collaborate with other uh uh people and use maybe your home as a hub but again the federations like you can you Confederate your Dao with like your best friends now or whatever and then you can Federate your homes down with your best friend's home style so then it's like oh hey like let's let's make some plans like for instance I have a private Discord set up for uh my for my house here and then my uh brother and sister-in-law's house um so imagine if that was automated like hey what what's uh what's my sister-in-law up to today let's go gardening or let's go hiking or something anyways getting highly speculative there I think you get the idea though is that is that a Dao is a way to create these ad hoc networks of AI agents that support us so going one step bigger we already mentioned this a little bit because uh blockchain is most interested uh most interest use is in blockchain in corporate use cases sorry I said that a little bit awkwardly um so imagine that you go a little bit bigger not just blockchain for Supply Chain management not just blockchain for financial tracking but what if you have your autonomous Workforce whether it's robots or digital agents like you know Auto GPT those sorts of things all collaborating on Adele so there's been plenty of experiments where people said like they made chat GPT CEO right what if you actually formalize that and so then instead of having one agent as CEO you have a board of hundreds or thousands of autonomous AI agents collaborating together to form your your board of directors basically uh then you can do that's at the highest level but then at the lowest level you can also automate your Workforce look at the meme at the very big beginning of the video where we talked about using you know AI to write and read emails putting all that information on a dow so that it is transparent and all the decisions that are made can be tracked that is one of the best ways to address that corporate governance because explainability and tracking who who decided what when and why and who approved this because oh man coming from the IT world change controls nightmare for any I.T people out there imagine that you're that your Change Control meetings all done on a dow automatically that's the way to go um then you know because all that information is transparent because AI can work tirelessly imagine that your company continuously self-optimizes right this is getting a little bit more speculative but this is within the realm of possibility going even bigger I already mentioned the possibility of um HOAs right so if any I have avoided HOAs like the plague um because you always have that Persnickety neighbor who has nothing better to do than just be a busybody and cause Havoc for other people often because they're bored or lonely or just miserly or whatever people become regions whatever reason it is they're they can be difficult now imagine that you take that and instead of you know humans having to attend meetings you have your personal Dow go and advocate for you on your neighborhood Dow and it'll go and talk for you and say you know this is what Dave's house needs these this is our beliefs and then you know Joanne Susan over there who is a busybody who has nothing better to do than spying her neighbors she doesn't even get to go to the meetings it's her personal to Algos and advocates for her the AIS discuss everything and come up with a legally viable and and and Community accepted solution based on the acceptance criteria and consensus mechanisms that everyone agrees on now that's just replacing HOA with a doubt what if we go one step further there's all kinds of stuff going on like co-living Eco Villages resource sharing ride sharing adao is a really good way to share those resources whether you've got solar panels shared water uh shared Vehicles all those kinds of things make a lot of sense to put on a dow because blockchain is a good way to track those so say for instance you know I put solar on my house and I produce 5000 uh extra Watts today that information is just stored on the dowel says Dave's house produced an extra you know 5000 Watts on April whatever and then everyone else like gets to track that and it's like okay in exchange for that and that that uh that energy that you gave back you know you get a few cryptocurrency tokens or whatever um that you can spend later in your community say for instance for Rideshare or you know if you want you know the neighborhood kid to mow your your yard um you pay him in that crypto or whatever something like that um so that is one way and it can go even one step further because what happens once you have more autonomous machine peripherals not just autonomous agents but autonomous machine peripherals that can be managed by the Dow What If instead of having the neighborhood kid mowed the yard there's uh you use the the most recent like John Deere uh autonomous tractor and so then your neighborhood or you know your your town or whatever owns that tractor and you can you can spend some of your solar crypto tokens to have it mow your yard for you automatically fully autonomous self-managed that sort of thing going one step bigger what if over time as we build trust and solve problems because like I said at the beginning blockchain and DOW still very immature Technologies they are not ready for this this is like years away so what I'm do this is aspirational thinking but imagine that you know 10 years from now 20 years from now however long it takes we build trust and we solve these problems and we start delegating all kinds of resources and management two things like AI dows tax management so the tax tax collection is done equitably and equally we uh we get rid of the IRS as it is today because it is slow and inefficient it is literally designed to be slow um you uh streamline Health Care insurance providers uh you manage education um with all this stuff uh all the infrastructure projects pretty much every individual agency one by one could either benefit from implementing something like an AI Dow or wholesale being replaced by an AI Dell honestly because my prediction is that as we figure out AI we will realize that humans are the weakest link in all things um in technology we have we have a few acronyms so there's an id10t error which is a idiot there's a layer 8 issue so if you're familiar with the OSI model layer 7 is application and layer 8 is user in most cases it's a layer 8 issue and then there's pepcac which is a problem exists between keyboard and chair so you get rid of the weakest link from all technology problems which is humans and you replace it with AI Dows and I think that we'll be in better shape um now one step bigger this is the most aspirational aspect that I have to pitch today and this is prop this is honestly probably decades away because one there's they're just at the low level there's a lot of technical problems that we have to solve before we can get to the possibility of a global AI dial beyond that there's geopolitical problems that we have to solve ain't no way most Nations on the on the on the planet today are going to decide to form Dao alliances and form a hierarchy of alliances right we just had Britain leave the European Union um because they didn't agree with some of the policies no way they're going to form a dow yet so this could be like centuries away but it is hypothetically within the realm of possibility and so you take all these ideas of consensus-based mechanisms algorithmic participation algorithmic decision making um which consensus is basically the purpose of democracy right democracy is is uh representative democracy is a way to arrive at political consensus What If eventually you kind of replace that with Dows and not just the decision-making process in which your personal Dao represents your interest globally but then you also use these to autonomously manage resources projects and all kinds of stuff so some of the examples I came up with is climate stewardship obviously we can't agree on that yet so you know we'll we'll uh we'll table that for later ecosystem preservation so this goes to um to monitoring and managing um uh indicators so for instance like the EPA European Union all kinds of agencies monitor things like biodiversity and health of the environment put all that information on a dow it makes sense resource optimization so this includes um things like natural resources uh and common resources Like Water and Air Global health is another thing so whether it is monitoring for future pandemics because we know that that can happen but also medical information imagine uh a global medical Dow that all of your diagnostic information is de-identified obviously but shared on the on the global Dow which can then be used to train better models for Better Health Care and then the cut the overall cost of healthcare continues to go down with the aid of AI and Global AI dows Disaster Response many of us remember the tsunamis that hit Japan and much of South Asia there's hurricanes there's tornadoes there's landslides there's all kinds of things where having a fully autonomous AI system that can react instantly or even proactively that could really help save lives peacekeeping and diplomacy so I mentioned in a previous video that that I've I've interviewed or no I was interviewed by someone in the state department he wrote about it I I don't I don't remember where he posted I think it was on medium but anyways um he told me about how folks in the state department in the Diplomatic Corps are already using chat GPT to help them do their work take that one logical step further and instead of you know humans arguing with each other and because we're emotional we're egotistical what if a a majority of diplomacy and peacekeeping is actually done algorithmically by AI take the human out of the loop and then you know consensuses reach proposals are adopted so on and so forth you know that's just one possibility space that space exploration Universal Prosperity Collective wisdom you put all of human desires whether it is to get off Planet whether it is to solve nuclear fusion or you know however it is that we all collectively want to live the things that we agree on can all be integrated into that Global Dao and then that Dao can help us Implement those things and then finally uh this was my favorite one from the brainstorming session was planetary guardianship which is what Tony Stark tried to do with Ultron but he needed blockchain and he needed consensus so you know take it with a grain of salt okay so I walked you through a whole bunch of imagination imaginary possibilities let's let's take a a little uh a little bit more practical example let's imagine in 2026 so just a few years from now Franklin Township doubt population 3200 typical rural American town uh town is pretty much broke due to AI layoffs that sort of stuff nobody can afford anything the town doesn't even have a mayor they have no full-time police they only have like a few uh volunteer firefighters everything is poorly managed because the economy has just totally collapsed Along Comes A cloud-based AI Dow company that says hey for five thousand dollars a year you will get high-end AI dial management of your entire town they say fine we can afford that so they sign up everyone in the in the township gets a phone app that allows them to connect their personal Dao or even just use the phone app to communicate with the entire rest of the town in terms of what they need what are they complaining about so say for instance there's a pothole you just take a picture put it in the in the uh the township AI Dao and it says got it we know it we'll take care of it um there can also be kiosks because not everyone is going to use a phone so you have like kiosks at like you know town hall or the bank or whatever um so that you and it you know uses face tracking voice uh recognition and that sort of thing so that you can also go and talk to the AIS about issues say for instance there's a safety concern because you know there's strange people coming through town you talk about it you add your information and then the town might ultimately decide hey we need to hire a a police officer or a security officer to patrol the streets or let's say you know the roads are in really bad shape so you say do we uh get a contract to maintain the roads or do we maintain the roads ourselves that sort of thing that's what I mean by consensus process now on top of just having that algorithmic consensus process they also have the benefit of high highly uh ex High expert AIS to help manage everything because one thing that can happen particularly in rural places and that this is not just in America this is globally is brain drain and so most places will do the best that they can but if all the smartest people leave your town because they left for the big city you might not have the expertise left to do anything this is also true for companies which we'll talk about in just a minute companies can suffer from brain drain too so imagine this AI provider brings you all the expertise that is that is embedded in gpt4 gpt5 the open source versions and the competitors that are coming and it algorithmically finds consensus and manages the town with high-end expertise so ultimately Franklin town the township of Franklin population 3200 three years from now they're back on track things are are being more well managed Town revenues are going up costs are going down and people are happier not only that the town is actually more attractive so some of the tech Bros like myself say hey why don't we move out to Franklin uh Franklin Township because it's cheaper and it's a pleasant little town now two years later Washington County where Franklin is says hey you know what they've been doing a really good job why don't we uh instead of instead of selling all of our Farmland to gigantic corporations what if we buy back that farmland and we manage it collectively with a dow so the so the Washington County Farm Dow creates a farm to table initiative um and also commercial initiative but the Dow is used to purchase the land bit by bit it controls the tractors the equipment all the contracts and it provides the local citizens jobs because the Dow can't do everything say for instance you have a tractor breakdown and it's like oh hey uh we know that Dave is pretty handy so let's you know Dave will get a little notification on his phone app saying hey you know tractor 42b broke down can you go take a look at it and it's like even if I can't fix it it's like just go take some pictures with your phone and listen to it something like that um and so then you know for that little bit of work that I do I get a little bit of extra cryptocurrency tokens which I can spend at the bar later if I want um then once the once the food is planted and it's harvested we all get to share some of the revenue because it's going to be probably you know sold at a co-op or at the grocery store it can also be sold on the open market and in that case the whole thing pays for itself and we the residents of Washington County are this are the primary stake holder and owner of this resource we cut out the middlemen no corporations anymore so again this is very very aspirational I don't know if it's even possible but it is hypothetically possible and I'd like to see someone try it now a few years later imagine that you know the Washington County ISP is organized by Adele right the farm was a was a raging success so we moved the the Washington County power you know the solar array over to Adele we moved management of the of the internet service provider over to Adele but also by this time by 2030 so seven years from now lots of other people are doing this so remember I talked about the idea of federating dows so what if every county in the state starts to do the same thing and then you Federate your Dows together to manage uh resources whether it's power internet Farms roads all of that stuff and eventually it gets to be a bigger and bigger set of alliances each of them advocating for their own needs and that information being integrated via consensus mechanisms and worked on by high-end language models to discuss it out and then one thing I want to point out is that there's no profit mode of here at least not from a corporate perspective not from a shareholder perspective the profit motive like so say for instance the Washington County Farm Dow there might be a profit motive to earn revenue for the you know citizens of Washington County but they are also the stakeholders and in this case for the national ISP Dow there's absolutely no profit motive the goal is just to provide uh consensus which in the case of an ISP Dow is provide everyone high-end internet whatever it takes then finally after a few more years again the government is slow by Design that's fine many cities counties and states are all adopting these AI Dows for all kinds of purposes obviously there's a lot of problems to overcome you know security we need to figure out consensus we need to make sure that we know we even know how to integrate large language models with with blockchain that is an open area of research but imagine that we figure out these problems and then over time all of these things get integrated and built into larger and larger systems and finally just by default one agency after another such as like the EPA or the um or the uh what is it the national um what is it the energy one anyways every governmental agency is run more and more by Dows and then ultimately we realize like hey the entire country is fully autonomous based on AI Dow technology so I have given you quite a uh let's say as I mentioned aspirational Journey um one thing that occurs to me is that by integrating uh AI with blockchain and Dell this is probably the best path to AGI and and not only that but safe and controllable AGI because one thing is that it by integrating AI with dowels with humans that intrinsically keeps humans in the loop for all time and this the Dow creates a natural place for humans and machines to collaborate so also because of consensus mechanisms you get Collective power basically collective bargaining power which also helps prevent you know radical and Rogue decisions from being made because if someone goes way off the deep end the whole you know the rest of the network the rest of the Dow is going to say let's not do that but let's address your concerns in another way in a healthier more constructive way and that is algorithmically enforced now one thing that I do want to concede is that this that this idea of AI Dao does not intrinsically solve the Malik problem um and for a quick recap the Malik problem is that even if everything is Opera operating um in an optimal State you might still be on an intrinsic uh backslide towards dystopia or Extinction so for instance you know if your life is going perfectly where you've got a good job you've got a family you've got kids and everyone else is doing the same thing we might still consume all the resources on the planet so that is the that is a really short way of explaining the Malik problem now that being said if we have true consensus and we achieve Global consensus we might be able to rein in some of the molecule driving forces like corporate greed that are one of the contributing factors towards you know environmental collapse true true Global consensus might also rein in global conflict and disagreements in war that also threatens to harm Humanity also given everything that I've laid out and a lot of this stuff is is a work in progress one big strength of this is that it is a very realistic path forward so I hope that that all makes sense um and as a final thought many of you are aware of my research on alignment which I call the heuristic imperatives so the heroistic imperatives for review in case you haven't heard of it before is to reduce suffering in the universe to increase prosperity in the universe and increase understanding in the universe so if you imbue those values into an individual language model that's great right it's pretty easy to do I've done fine-tuning experiments you can use it with system prompts it's not a big deal we're going to be doing more research and Publishing more findings and data and data sets so that it's easier to align even open source Foundation models to my heuristic imperatives however that is just one agent one model in a much larger ecosystem if you then include the heroes to comparatives as a consensus mechanism in your dowels so say for instance your personal dial the consensus mechanism for all the eight all the AI agents that use is that it must increase it must reduce your suffering increase your prosperity and increase your understanding that can be a way to help steer your Dow to maximize the value of your life and I don't mean value like economic value I mean the the subjective personal value for you to your life and so what I'm recommending is that we not just recommending this is something that we're working on in my um heuristics imperative research Group which oh by the way if you want to join there's a link in the description it's a Google form fill it out please provide detail if you don't provide much detail we don't have much to go on so we kind of ignore those but basically uh the the One Direction of research is to use heuristic imperatives as a consensus mechanism such that only aligned AI um is allowed to participate in Dallas uh which will intrinsically exclude malicious AI uh whatever whatever means they use to gain their alignment right whether you know an AI agent uses my heroes to comparatives or not is irrelevant if the Dow adopts the heuristic imperatives as the gating mechanism as the consensus mechanism to automatically accept ideas and data from otherwise unknown autonomous agents um so I think that that is a pretty uh insightful uh direction to go um so as a quick recap there are now three primary ways to implement uh heuristic imperatives one is through fine-tuning and reinforcement learning as I mentioned research papers and data sets are coming the second is in blockchain and DOW technology and third is in architectural design patterns such as task orchestration and stuff like that which a lot of you are familiar with now that um cognitive architectures are becoming more commonplace so all that being said thank you for watching I hope that you got a lot out of this um please get in touch either via patreon or the Forum or wherever else that you can find me if you're interested in participating or contributing have a good one bye
