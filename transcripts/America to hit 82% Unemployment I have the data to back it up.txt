all right so there's a bit to unpack here but before we get started I want to uh profess this whole thing with take it with a gigantic grain of salt uh my methods are highly dubious and my data quality is uh abysmal let's say but it's an interesting thought experiment so let's dive in um all right so we'll start with the conclusion and then work backwards so right now at least May 2022 so just over a year ago 13 months ago America had 147 million employees ish 148 million now based on the current capabilities of AI what this includes all machine automation robotics artificial intelligence my estimate is that we could automate away almost 25 million jobs today now that requires the deployment of new products and services so those products and services do not exist yet but the underpinning technology does which means that the only thing preventing us from from getting that employment is just inertia the time that it takes to develop the products and software the time to get it approved and the time to implement it and then make those changes so as of right now almost 25 million jobs are vulnerable to AI with the capabilities of GPT 3.5 turbo and gpt4 and then of course all the other open source uh and and Commercial competitors that are near peer adversaries now that being said if you look at the jobs that uh based on a job's intrinsic requirement for humans uh basically you look at the the kinds of jobs that you're going to pay to have a person doing regardless of what the AI is capable of this is these are the jobs that are going to be vulnerable just by virtue of the fact that you don't really necessarily need a human doing it the numbers become a little bit scarier and uh my estimate this is worst case scenario is that in the near future 77 million jobs out of the 140 seven million jobs are vulnerable to be to being automated away basically this calculation is a rough estimate on market demand how much do you actually want a human doing that particular job which means that in the worst case scenario we go from 148 million employed to 70 million employed that is more than 50 percent lost so I have been repeatedly saying you know we could face 70 unemployment 80 and other people say 80 unemployment here's the numbers to back it up all right now since I got your attention let me tell you how I did this and again remember this is incredibly dubious so take it with a huge grain of salt but basically what I did was I took the gpt40613 model and I gave it instructions I said you are a BLS chat bot and you're trying to assess the risk of having jobs automated away uh yada yada yada the tldr is that I asked it to uh judge jobs or occupations based on job activities and I had it break it down into percentages uh based on three categories so the first category is is dexterity so this is high friction uh in in physical space that requires compliance uh manual dexterity uh kinetic intelligence that sort of stuff because yes we do have a few robots that can do this but there are as of right now no general purpose robots that are capable of operating anywhere near human level in terms of dexterity there are no general purpose surgical robots there are no general purpose labor robots uh just doesn't exist now that being said you can robotically automate like a skid steer or a tractor or something that's fine that's not what I'm talking about um I'm talking about what a human can do with your hands and body and then the second category is solo work so this is work that can be done in front of a computer or otherwise electronically by yourself uh you know on your phone on a computer that sort of thing and then the third category of job activities is group stuff so this is communication collaboration face-to-face time with other humans and so those three categories break down and and kind of Judge the that's part of what I use to judge the vulnerability of a job so if it if it has low dexterity it is much at much greater risk of being automated away uh just with today's technology uh if it is mostly solo work it is much higher risk of being automated away and if it's a high group activity then it's a much lower risk because that indicates that the human com the human connection component is a big part of it and then finally the vulnerability score is a standalone score which is used to uh basically uh assess how how much you want a human doing that job what is the intrinsic uh need for that job and if the number is lower if that means it's less vulnerable which means you're more likely to really want to have a human in that job and you're willing to pay for that whereas if it's a high vulnerability score then that means that there's no intrinsic economic or personal or whatever there's no intrinsic demand to have a human in that job if you could automate it away then you might as well and so this is like machine shop workers right you don't need a whole heck of a lot of empathy or communication skills and I can hear all the machinists saying yeah like hell because machine is a machinists actually do have to do a tremendous amount of communication that being said the actual Hands-On machine stuff that that part could be automated away if of course the machines become more dexterous right because dexterity is a huge component of that so that's why I broke it down into these four categories of vulnerability and I had chat GPT just kind of do these rough estimates and it did a pretty good job using gpt4 so I ran I downloaded the data from BLS and I excluded the detail in Broad ones because they're they're they're very very highly specific and I noticed that it was like okay the job duties really didn't change so I only focused on the minor and major categories which ended up being um let's see that was 116 categories so that's still 116 categories uh that it was used to estimate um in terms of vulnerability and I've got it all color coded so I'll tell you how to interpret the data in a second um here's the here's the thing so the first thing uh the first sorry good grief I'm going too fast here's the repository the first step of this is to break it down uh it just it's very very simple you open the data the CSV data pipe it in you get the result it pipes it back out in Json and I can show you an example of the debug here so I just it captures everything occupation code description and employment so that's what it gives it so that it understands and of course chat GPT already knows what all the occupation codes actually mean because it's baked into the training data and so if you go and talk to like chat gbt and say like hey what is BLS occupation code 17-1000 mean give me some examples and it'll it can give you a good explanation now one thing that I had it do was to in the output it actually tells me why it made the judgments that it did so this is where explainability comes in so uh here's an example of the final output for uh code 41-3000 sales representatives and services total current employment is 2.1 million uh dexterity rather low you know you got to call some people um you know a significant portion of their work can be done solo on a computer such as managing customer databases and orders which make it susceptible to automation however a large part of their job about 60 percent involves group collaboration and communication such as face-to-face meetings negotiations which is difficult to automate the intrinsic technological vulnerability is estimated at 40 so it's a relatively low vulnerability uh job because yes there are some things that you can automate away but in general you want to be talking to a human sales rep it to close the deal so in this case uh the the numbers kind of all come together to say okay uh let's see we uh this estimated that we might lose about twenty six thousand jobs um or no sorry uh 255 000 jobs uh leaving 1.86 million instead of the 2.1 million because again if you can automate if you can automate away a third or you know a quarter or a half of a job that reduces the demand for people doing that and if you have tools that can accelerate it and make it easier then you uh then of course you have less demand for someone in that role now that being said this vulnerability score means that in general you still want to have a human there even if you have less demand for humans overall aggregate demand so think of it in terms of aggregates okay so uh that is how I achieved that and um let's see I kind of lost my train of thought okay I guess we can go over the code it's all pretty straightforward I've got it documented um it it dumps it all out into the yaml files here so you can look at all however many there are 116 so you can look at the reasoning that it used for each one and you can you can monkey around with this if you want uh you can rerun it all the code is there to regenerate this data but then I got it all into this and so this is uh the total data and I've got it color coded so I have total number of jobs lost and this is color coded so that the the higher the number the darker or the more red it is and of course it's not proportionate so I added a percentage lost and so this is this column here the jobs lost in percentage loss this is most likely based on some really rough numbers uh based on what AI what I know AI is capable of today and so remember here's my credibility I was an I.T automation engineer I've deployed servers and software and cloud and everything to automate uh and and support businesses and and I've integrated all these systems I know what it takes to run these systems and to do the job of like a DBA and business analyst and you know Financial you know comptroller I I talked to everyone when I was in a corporate job so that being said remember like I'm basically throwing wet spaghetti at the wall so this is a educated guess uh as to percentage of jobs that could be automated away obviously I'm less familiar with uh blue collar jobs with manual labor jobs I have done them in the past uh I've I've worked nights in in stores and warehouses so I kind of have a feel for that that being said um you know I have poured concrete but not professionally so you know take some of that with a grain of salt now percent loss you see some of the higher ones computer and mathematical operations okay yeah that makes sense um stuff with a low percentage loss occupational therapy and physical therapists assistance and AIDS this is at a very very very low risk of being automated away because it is one it's a highly dexterous job and you also very much want a human I've dated a physical therapist before and it is an intensely emotional job and it has to do with communication verbal and non-verbal communication there's tremendous amount of human connection involved in that so I totally agree with the result here where you know health support and stuff so all these numbers are jobs that are at very very low vulnerability uh for being automated away um and then you see oh wait here's a big chunk here so Communications uh clerks information uh handling material recording secretaries uh other office and admin all at high very high risk of getting automated away because again these are things that you primarily do in front of a computer agricultural workers this is uh you know eight and a half percent because again you know some of it will be automated away and you see most of them are around kind of like the 10 to 12 percent range um you know with a few few categories being much much more vulnerable to automation now that being said there is uh I have a second sheet and in the second sheet what I did was I removed all the major categories um so you see like it's 11-10011-2000 so I removed 11-000 so that we would have a finer grain view to look at the total data for each of the the the minor categories and so here um it's it's the same same pattern obviously I just removed some of the stuff so that we'd have more accurate in terms of total numbers now what I did was I uh you know I estimated total jobs lost that could be automated away right now so that's right here uh so that's that's how I arrived at that data is okay based on all these vulnerabilities scores and stuff what is the what is the maximum jobs loss that we could anticipate here uh and then of course you just take that away from you know total remaining etc etc simple simple arithmetic now over here I said okay let's ignore what Ai and Robotics are capable of today and let's just look at the uh the aggregate demand for humans in a particular job and so for instance in computer occupations there's not really a strong need to have humans doing that to do most of those jobs uh you know if the computer works nobody cares uh as as an example and as a former I.T specialist I can tell you that my Humanity didn't really matter uh it was as long as as long as the lights were on and the you know the registers were running nobody cares uh drafters engineering techs a little bit less demand um let's see there's some yeah so what are these uh Communications operation operators clerks these are at super high risk agricultural workers so this is this is one of the ones that's kind of a paradox because on the one hand right now it's at a very low risk because it requires a tremendous amount of dexterity but as long as the food gets on the table it doesn't matter who put it there so in terms of intrinsic vulnerability it is a very high intrinsic vulnerability so that's why I've got all these color coded here um let's see uh yep so there that's that and so what I used there was to say like what is the maximum possible attrition we could see based on you know okay if we can get rid of 20 of Executives that's so that's basically what this means is that the aggregate demand for uh Executives for top Executives goes down by 20 because we can automate away a lot of it and you know make the things easier and faster and so on and so forth so that means we could have an attrition of seven hundred thousand Executives leaving us with 2.9 Million Executives uh and you know but then you go down and because this is Imagining the future where it's like okay let's take the Farm Workers the agricultural workers uh for example and so right now we have uh looks like we've got a total employment of 390 000. um but there's only so much demand for that so imagine we put AI in every John Deere tractor every combine every Hopper system and you basically have you know Farm entire Farms with no humans that's what this .85 means so we'd have an attrition rate of 85 percent leaving only 58 000 farmers in America total now of course this does not include seasonal labor so that's uh slightly different construction workers this is another example where um the it's kind of it's kind of a mixed bag so the attrition rate here would be expected to be about 40 percent but then again like this is a super highly dexterous thing with with that is primarily uh collaborative work so this is going to be a very very very difficult one to automate away because it's very high risks if a robot makes a mistake an I-beam gets dropped on someone and they get killed right and so it actually you'll probably have a threshold where it'll be safer and cheaper to just take humans off the job site entirely now that being said we are already seeing that a little bit with like the 3D printing home printers where it's like a robotic Gantry that just sits over there it's got its pile of material and it just builds the house with no humans involved at all and so that's what we have to look out for is that in some of these cases there's going to be this saltatory leap where it goes from you know four and a half million employees to zero very quickly because as these new technologies rolled out you're going to replace them all wholesale there is some things are not going to lend themselves to being gradualistically replaced truckers are going to be the same thing once we figure out how to automate trucks truck driving it's just not going to make sense to have truck drivers now that being said that's a very high threshold but once to reach that threshold it's a step change so that's what I mean by saltatory leaps that's that's a step change it's a more common term versus gradualistic where you kind of replace people slowly in some cases where you replace people slowly that could be like I.T staff right as a former automation engineer I can tell you that I have personally reduced head count in infrastructure departments by automating away jobs which reduce the demand but it was over time right it was like okay well we can do more with less let me automate a little bit more and then we can do more with less and so on and so forth and then eventually it was basically just me running the whole department by myself as an automation engineer not everything lends itself to that but that being said the amount of logic that goes into making decisions even financial decisions or executive decisions or HR decisions a lot of this is now within the realm of possibility of GPT Technologies so when I say that we could we could get rid of almost 25 million jobs right now that's a number that I will stand behind again it's going to take time because there's inertia but then in terms of total risk of jobs that might go away for good looking at 77 million jobs in America leaving us with only 70 million jobs and we have a population of what 350 million or 400 million right now so that's an employment rate that is very very low that's a very high unemployment rate if if that comes to pass and again some of these things are dependent upon robotic advancements that are actively being worked on construction robots surgical robots general purpose domestic robots so that the aggregate demand for human labor is going to fall off a freaking Cliff that being said like okay you know what happens with when you have 70 million people which is less than a third of uh the Americans out there let's see what is it um I don't remember the population but let's say we have 380 million Americans right now and we end up with only 70 million jobs um oh wait uh where's the invert there we go so that is a that is only 18 of our current employment so that means we'd be having an unemployment rate of about 82 percent um yeah so we go if if we end up with an unemployment rate of 82 percent uh that is not good uh based on current paradigms and so when people say oh well you know Dave you keep advocating for Universal basic income and that's socialism well if one out of if only one out of five people have a job we got to do something right if there it's that simple um now one thing that I wanted to point out is that people are like well where's the money going to come from where does money already come from money is created through uh through minting money and giving loans to central banks and who do the central banks give money to they lend it out to other Banks and corporations that's where money comes down from it doesn't come from the bottom up money is created at the center of the economic system and then it percolates outwards so when I when I mention in another video recently that uh B2B transactions are going to be what drives the economy that's what I'm referring to uh because you know if a company lends money to another company or bank or whatever and then they have goods and products and services the aggregate consumer demand is only part of that uh part of that equation uh because if if you have a lights out company that's selling goods and services to another lights out company the economy is going to be red hot even though there's no humans involved so that's why I mentioned in my in my uh macroeconomics or sorry post labor economics video that we're going to need new kpi and we're also going to need to redistribute that because right now the only way that money gets into the hands of consumers is through either the the very few uh entitlement programs that we do have uh which are relatively weak or through uh employment through money coming by force of extraction downwards uh through the through the grapevine from the central banks to the regional Banks to the corporations and then finally to us but if we if we reverse that if instead so this is basically what Universal basic income is to me if instead of lending money to from uh from you know the Federal Reserve to the central banks to the regional Banks what if we instead uh take about half of that and just give it instead of lending it out to Banks we just give it to Consumers and you just you just flip the the system uh on its head and so then the total amount of economic change is pretty much identical you're not printing any more money than you already were anyways this is all very uh getting very abstract point is uh there's a lot of change coming and here's some numbers to back it up thanks for watching
