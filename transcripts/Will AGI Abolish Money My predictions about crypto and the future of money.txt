will AGI destroy money will the future be cashless this is actually a question that comes up uh more often than you might think so we're going to unpack the idea of resource-based economies and a cryptocurrency future so let's get right into it so first just a little bit of background in in terms of history when we say money when we say currency what do we mean uh today obviously you're familiar with it as uh paper cash most of it is exchanged digitally today uh but there's a few primary criteria few primary functions that money serves so first is it's a medium of exchange this allows you to buy and sell goods and services with an abstracted thing uh and money and currency of various forms have has existed for quite a long time there's evidence that uh that protohumans you know exchanged things like beads and shells and you know round stones or whatever in order to uh basically Drive A Primitive economy it's also a St store of value and so what this means is it's not it's it doesn't store like something that is materially value it's not like hoarding food but by by virtue of the fact that money allows you to accumulate wealth you can save it for a rainy day uh the idea there is then you can save it for a later time and use it and because it's a store of value that offers a pretty unique functionality that's why we have bank accounts that's why we have Banks uh it is a unit of account so this is an interesting uh interesting one in that it is an abstracted representation of value uh and it allows you to account to say like okay how much is my property over here worth how much is this service that I can provide worth um it it creates a way of attaching a number to pretty much everything which is one of the most useful things uh that you can do particularly in an environment where you have to uh monitor scarcity and and deal in a scarce environment and allocate resources based on what you need more and what costs more as already mentioned there's been physical and digital forms whether it's you know Cold Hard Cash Gold to Bloons or you know cryptocurrency or you know whatever and then finally legal tender so legal tender is is a that's basically legal jar jargon for saying the the law of the land is that you can accept money in exchange for goods and services and that's part of the fiat currency system now we can't talk about money and cash without talking about the gold standard so the gold standard was basically uh true up until the early 20th century where wherein All Nations respected gold as a valid valid form of exchange valid form of currency and all other currencies were were tied directly to the value of gold so this gold standard uh basically was a way of saying okay regardless of what uh your local currency is worth it will convert to a standard amount of gold which is is then portable to other nations and this kind of fixed exchange rate and I'm not saying it was fixed globally um but that basically incentivized every nation to have a uh a reserve of gold and of course like in America we have Fort Knox right which is the kind of the the national reserve of gold Boolean um but the thing is is gold is a fixed resource it's a finite resource so it's technically uh deflationary which means that the value of gold goes up drastically over time particularly when it is used for that and hoarded because the the supply of gold goes down over time because it ends up in static coffers like Fort Knox and so that was actually a big reason for the push for fiat currency and that is it's kind of counterintuitive it's like yeah but gold holds its value it's like well yes it does but it is also a finite uh physical resource and when you base in economy or a currency system on an arbitrary physical resource that puts a lot of constraints on the economy in the long run um and that's actually why we moved to uh the Fiat system which we'll go over in just a moment uh but one other thing that you need to know before we get uh too much further is just about the monetary system overall I'm not going to spend too much time on this uh but basically the monetary system is the set of structures and institutions and policies that dictate the supply of money and the circulation of money so there's a few primary players one is a central bank um like in in in America we call it the Federal ederal Reserve there's commercial Banks which are the the big you know for-profit Banks the loans and lending that deal that drive much of the economy so for instance you know if Microsoft takes out a loan they go to a large Commercial Bank the government also has a powerful role uh because what you might not realize is that the Federal Reserve is actually quasi independent from the US government it's not entirely and it's like okay well it's called Federal Reserve so you know kind of says that it just in the name it's it's closely tied with the federal government however the the the three branches of the government you know the legislative judicial and executive branch do also play a role in the economy so there's two primary different ways one is monetary policy which has to do with the supply of money and the and the circulation of money and then there's fiscal policy which has to do with budgets so it's one one thing to keep in mind is that those are two separate things we're not going to have a deep dive into the US economy or glob economy um but then the one last component of uh the monetary system is the international institutions such as the World Bank the IMF and a few others uh so basically most economies are uh kind of islands unto themselves the only the the the largest um International entity that we have that is a that is a monetary system is the European Union with the Euro and of course like as people often remind me because I mated it once uh Britain is no longer part of the European Union but anyways they maintained the pound sterling separate from the Euro anyways so these kinds of tensions persist today and this is this will actually figure greatly into kind of my reading of the te leaves as to how AGI is going to impact uh the monetary system in the future okay so as promised we are now at the transition to fiat currency so the transition to fiat currency was a very very uh controversial move at the time um as far as I remember there were there were threats of like like some people thought that this was going to cause the second Civil War like it was that bad the idea was that by removing the gold standard by saying you know what we're going to decouple the economy from uh this arbitrary physical resource and now we're going to have this uh we're going to enable this very flexible monetary policy where we can control inflation and deflation based on the printing of money one thing to point out is that in the interceding time over the last century all major economies have switched to fiat currency which gives the the people in control of the economy more levers over how the monetary system plays out which is why we have things like you know the FED adjusted their interest rate and so when the FED adjust their interest rate basically what they're doing is they are changing the rate at which more money is introduced into the system in order to ideally control inflation and deflation uh but as we've seen lately uh the is not always aware of all the variables that play which is why we have very high inflation right now um and you know like mortgage rates are close to 8% which we haven't seen in America in like I think 30 or 40 years so something else is going on that is just beyond uh the monetary systems comprehension right now which is interesting time will tell but this has always been the case so as we move forward like let's talk about Alternatives so one alternative that I remember was really popular popular in the 9s and uh I think it survived into the early 2000s I don't remember but it was called eold and so this was basically like a really early attempt at saying let's bring back the gold standard but we're going to allow you to buy and trade uh gold electronically now obviously we have extra we have ETFs today you can have precious metal ETFs um so if you're not familiar an ETF is an exchange traded fund so you can basically buy and sell like corn and oil Futures and uh gold and platinum pretty much any matal you want you can buy and sell on the stock market today eold was an early attempt and uh it had a pretty spectacular Downfall with the founders getting arrested for money laundering and and uh illegally running uh exchanges so it was very [Music] interesting ensen good to see you have a seat I've uh noticed that you have not been availing yourself of the officer club now as a member of this crew you have a right and are entitled to join the Officers Club which will be a critical part of your development as an officer and member of this crew so I just wanted to take this moment to invite you and say that you're really missing out by not joining in on the conversation uh now of course as any exclusive Club there are dues that are required but the benefits I guarantee you will far outweigh the cost of joining the Officer's Club carry on of course we've also seen some very spectacular uh uh exchange crashes recently um and there's a lot of people that are very hurt by these exchange crashes so you know your mileage may vary uh and it's everyone is obviously allowed to have their own opinion in my personal opinion I think that Rogue exchanges probably ought to be shut down um okay so moving forward uh obviously eold was a failure blockchain is all the rage right now and so what I want to do is I want to differentiate between blockchain and cryptocurrency blockchain is nothing other than a distributed public ledger so what does that mean transactions are recorded publicly now obviously you say oh well transactions are recorded publicly great that lends itself to cryptocurrency but it also lends itself to other kinds of transactions uh several companies or countries have tried to move their their stock uh stock exchanges to blockchain technology uh some I know at least one had to had to undo that because it didn't work out due to technical glitches um other other countries some smaller countries are trying to use blockchain to integrate for voting systems uh so basically the idea is that they're decentralized they're uh they're highly secure they're transparent um and so on and so forth which all lends itself to saying like hey this is a great technology because if it's tamperproof then it and everyone can inspect every transaction then that would be really great for democracy that would be really great for accountability and transparency there are still a lot of technical bugs to to hammer out with blockchain but IBM VMware Microsoft all the major tech companies are investing in blockchain research now so that tells me that it's only a matter of time before we see blockchain literally everywhere so this is one thing that I kind of count on in the future is blockchain for business blockchain for government block chain for everything uh is probably coming now cryptocurrency specifically is a kind of digital currency that is predicated on blockchain technology and so basically you say okay by whatever means the cryptocurrency is generated usually it's proof of stake proof of work um that sort of thing it's a cryptographic process and then you generate electronic currency that the transactions happen on a blockchain this is basically an Unstoppable techn ology uh and we'll get into that in a little bit when I kind of evaluate like what is the actual long-term aspect going to be and I know that this video is about AGI and we're not there yet but I needed to provide a little bit of background and framing to so that you understand okay this is where I'm coming from obviously cryptocurrency is a big topic not going to spend a whole lot of time explaining what cryptocurrency is just wanted to differentiate between blockchain and cryptocurrency they're not the same thing um but you you basically cannot have cryptocurrency without blockchain so you there there you have it Global Currency so this is a hypothetical thing that doesn't exist yet and it occurs to me that with the current trends uh you know the the US Petro dollar was an attempt at basically having one nation enforce a global Reserve currency um but as we have seen uh the the time of the US Petro dollar is is ending if not already already over the the and now we have other uh economies such as you know China the EU America all competing and so rather than having one Global Currency it seems like we're moving towards a place of having multiple Global currencies and so the idea though is that this is each of these currencies are still staked to various uh geopolitical entities so like obviously the US manipulates the US dollar for for our favor China ulates its currency for its favor the EU favors the the Euro for its you know its purposes and when you have the monetary system weaponized like this CU that's it's nothing short than weaponizing currency that kind of doesn't lend itself to Global Peace and Harmony and so the idea is that maybe we should have a neutral Global Currency that is resistant to manipulation and resistant to tampering that is also cross border and so this is where it's like when I first heard of Bitcoin many many years ago I said like my initial reaction as soon as I I like wrapped my head around it I said this is obviously the way of the future um like that was like very like I I don't know if I said it out loud but like I said it to myself I was like oh yeah this is very obviously the way of the future it solves so many problems however you know it's we're what 14 years on into a Bitcoin and um it hasn't taken over the world yet but everyone knows about it at least so the reason that I mentioned Global Currency is just because with without a Global Currency we humans are still in a somewhat precarious state in terms of our relationship to money we don't have something that is 100% portable except for cryptocurrency and governments are not using cryptocurrency yet now obviously there are some experiments out there um people in Silicon Valley are trying something you know like Sam alman's worldcoin I personally think that worldcoin is a bad idea and like the idea that you need to scan your iris in order to even participate in the network is really kind of dystopian um I've read about experiments or thought experiments that basically say in the future we're all going to have crypto wallets and rather than having one currency we're going to have uh we're going to have portfolios of currency probably literally hundreds of currencies that are all automatically exchanged and so you know even if one currency is volatile another one might you know not be as volatile and so that the idea is it you will actually have a composite Global cryptocurrency in the future which I think is is one of the most likely outcomes in the long run there are some major challenges to cryptocurrency in terms of why it has not been fully adopted uh not the least of which is lack of Regulation by Design cryptocurrency is resistant to regulation that's kind of the point and because it is resistant to uh regulation and manipulation that basically takes the power away from governments which governments really don't like um but it puts it into the hands of less scrupulous in uh organizations and so we have seen plenty of evidence of uh cryptocurrency being manipulated by organized crime uh particularly the Yakuza and the Russian mafia uh it also allows it for a lot of illicit uses such as Black Market exchanges now obviously people that are more in the individual liberty Camp will say well this is a good thing because if I now have a currency that allows me to buy and sell goods and services that the you know that the the bully government tells me that I'm not allowed to sell this is good for my individual Freedom yes but it's not necessarily good for the individual freedom of people that are victims of human trafficking and so because of that the the the reputation of cryptocurrency is deeply tarnished right now and uh if if the government's reaction to cryptocurrencies anything to go by then the government's reaction to AGI will be probably equally as bad uh and what I mean by that is they've been kind of slow to react and rather than you know rather than being proactive they're they're barely even reactive at least in my opinion um of the American government and so that now of course like cryptocurrency has been declared not a currency it is just a uh it is it is a commodity which is an interesting way of approaching it but that's how the IRS classifies cryptocurrencies it's not a currency it's a commodity um now because cryptocurrency is highly P portable it is intrinsically borderless which is really good and will help steer us towards that global economy um but again the Trust In cryptocurrency is really low right now and there's a lot of technical problems that need to be iron out but in the long run I do think that this is the way of the future so this brings us to the possibility of a resource-based economy so if you're not familiar with the concept of a resource-based economy the idea is that you get rid of uh money or Tender or any uh kind of that uh you get rid of debt and basically all goods and services are provided uh for free they're just given to you uh and the idea here is that well what we do is we get we move away from money and we just give people what they need and we do this with technological hyper abundance um which is a lovely idea however there are a lot of problems with resource-based economies um not the least of which is how do you decide what gets exchanged and this also fails to take into account uh scarce resources uh it also fails to take into account human nature which I think means that this is absolutely doomed to fail but I needed to bring it up and just say like hey like yeah there are some ideas here that like you know it could be more sustainable it could be more uh egalitarian um and I'll say yes but while I think that a totally resource-based economy is uh neither possible nor desirable I will say that there are probably some aspects of a resource-based economy that we will see in the relatively near future so this also can't mention resource based economy with without mentioning the Venus Project this has been mentioned quite a few times in uh the comment section so basically this the Venus Project is an organization trying to bring this about and they have very similar goals to what I have uh you know bring about some positive social change high standards of living uh get away from or or move towards technological solutions so on and so forth so of course it's like well Dave this is obviously a natural fit for you yes but I don't agree with resource-based economy because it you you basically have to throw out some very important aspects about human uh human nature in order to believe that this will work and I'll get to that in just a moment so basically though the the the question here is should we abolish currency what are the arguments for getting rid of it and there are actually some good Arguments for getting rid of money first and foremost promoting equality if you say that equality is a good thing if you say that income inequality is bad that wealth inequality is bad if your moral framework and your uh your social objectives and your social policy say that then like yeah destroying money could be a way of promoting equality however when you look at history you don't necessarily need money to have wealth inequality and I'm thinking about feudal Lords uh people who have control over land and other valuable resources still are the wealthiest and so you could still have uh extreme wealth inequality with a resource-based economy and just destroying money is like that's kind of a solution in search of a problem that's just going after a symptom not the actual root cause that's why I'm pretty skeptical of a resource-based economy at least a total resource-based economy another hypoth hypothetical benefit of abolishing currency is reducing crime if you get to a point where people uh have all of their basic needs met which is that's something that I would advocate for but I don't think that a resource based economy is the way to get to it but basically you get rid of money you get rid of cryptocurrency you get rid of this this abstract thing that is highly portable that takes the wind out of the sales of organized criminals you give all the B all the people their basic needs met and so then uh petty crime also goes away because then nobody has a has a reason to steal or do drugs because they're not trying to escape from you know the misery of being poor or whatever again really good ideals but I don't think this is the right approach uh and then of course there's you know the technological feasibility there's a lot of other problems with this not the least of which is okay you get rid of people for you know or you not get rid of people you get rid of money for people like you and me that doesn't do anything to address international trade or Commerce and so this is what I think is one of the biggest gaps in terms of things like resource-based economics and the Venus Project is that it only looks at the economy the the fiscal uh policy from an individual consumer level it doesn't take into account the broader uh monetary system so again this is why I'm particularly skeptical of resource-based Economics um and the Venus Project now again I completely agree with some of the ideals and some of the goals I just don't think it's the right approach so on the other on the flip side of that there is also a lot of argument to be made for preserving currency um and not just one currency but multiple currencies so economic stability the fact that we have many currencies to choose from globally is actually kind of a good thing um you know you can you can use the you know the dollar here in the US you can use um you can use Euros in in Europe and also in many places the economic system already allows you to just automatically exchange stuff I remember when I visited France 10 years ago I could use my Visa debit card anywhere and it would just automatically convert stuff um and so having multiple currencies uh that that can be exchanged the world over um even with the geopolitical tensions that cause some currency manipulation that's obviously suboptimal for stability in the long run so there's some work to be done um to create more uh comprehensive exchanges um and and maybe even nationless currencies but we're a long way is off from that as a species like I said the euro is the closest that we've got because it's not just one nation it is a union of Nations um but of course there are plenty of problems with that uh namely that the exchange rate favors some members of the EU over others so will we end up with a global set of Reserve currencies who knows um but valuation so remember how earlier we talked about that currency was a good unit of account as well as a medium of exchange there is a there this to me is why currency and money is such a powerful invention for us humans is that it is it is not obvious from nature but because we have uh because we have a need for possession we have a need for appraising value creating an abstract representation of value is really a great invention and there's all kinds of other reasons that flow into this which I'll unpack a few in just a moment but I think it would be kind of silly to do away with one of our most powerful economic inventions so I'm strongly in the camp of keep currency there's a lot of reasons to keep it now another reason is even if you wanted to get rid of currency you wanted to abolish fiat currency you wanted to abolish uh gold uh as a as as a medium of exchange and you wanted to abolish cryptocurrency you kind of can't you can do that can't stop the signal now uh but cryptocurrency is very resilient by design it is decentralized it is borderless it is user controlled um getting rid of cryptocurrency is basically going to be impossible so whether or not you agree with the existence of cryptocurrency good luck turning it off and so again I often will favor a realis view not an idealized View and it's like well yeah you can wish for a cashless future in which there is no money and there's no economy and everyone just gets what they needs and and it's all hunky dory but I don't see that as practically happening whether or not we have AGI um in order to you know provide all those goods and services and to uh and to allocate resources so like going back to the idea of resource-based economy and and AGI like I don't think AGI really plays a fact here now one thing that I will agree with though is that in the age of AGI when we have energy abundance when we have no jobs you know because AI has taken it all um I do suspect that we will have a reduced need for cash on a day-to-day basis and so what I mean by this is okay you know AGI can provide any service for basically free any necessary Service uh whether it's building a house repairing your house uh providing legal counsel or you know therapy or whatever like it's going to AGI is probably hopefully not going to have the same uh kind of possessive view of money that we have and as long as it's you know relatively aligned we should be in a situation where uh many goods and services become incredibly cheap to practically free the marginal cost of many goods and services will be near zero and so those might be public and so the best model that we have for this is public roads and public schools and so if we imagine that that uh government provided services will expand at least somewhat when it makes economic sense then it's like okay well you don't have to like send your child to school with money every day to pay a toll to get into school obviously there are private schools uh but imagine that like your power bill is basically P paid for by the state your internet is paid for by the state and oh by the way there are some that already do this um your healthare is already paid for by the state so that like most of what you need on a day-to-day basis money just never enters the picture so some people will say well yeah that's what we mean by resource-based economy it's like yeah but you can't get you can't get away from money in totality and so we'll talk about that in just a moment as well there are some durable needs for currency uh so even if we even if we get to a future and I suspect that we will we get to a future where you don't need money on a day-to-day basis you could probably go for days weeks even months without you know your wallet uh because we get to a point where most of your daily Necessities are uh provided you know either um through some sort of redistributive policy or whatever there are always going to be scarce goods and services and so what I mean by that is you know favored vacation spots or fancy concerts or nice dinners um these are all things that figure Into The Human Condition and things like resource-based economics seem to just gloss over that that fact um and so when you BL when you gloss over that fact when you ignore the fact that like it is just human nature to want nice things now obviously everyone to to to everyone a quote unquote nice thing or desirable thing is different you know some people want a fancy house want a fancy car want to live by the beach want to live on the lake and then there's also people who want to live simply and humbly as I've mentioned in other videos I want to live like a hobbit in the countryside but that is still something that I want and I need a a system in which I can work towards that and earn it and and and basically guar you know have some sort of self-direction in order to decide my own fate rather than just having it fully just allocated to me by some arbitrary decision um particularly an arbitrary decision made by an algorithm that's no way to live because taking agency teing taking Authority away from someone is actually runs directly contrary to human nature and basic human needs and so it's like well you don't want to deprive people of of individuality and personhood cuz then we're no better than the Borg um there's also luxury goods now obviously uh some people are like yeah but luxury goods are only for the rich and to hell with them as I'm reading this book called the status game I'm realizing that everyone wants more status and luxury goods and luxury experiences are just one way of doing that and even if you de identify with that even if you have like nothing but resentment and contempt for the rich you're still a human being and you also deserve you deserve some level of status and you want to be able to earn some level of status and in no way am I saying ah you know this is this is a cart carda blanch you know the the rich are all righteous and and virtuous I'm not making the argument of like virtuous billionaires that's not what I'm saying what I am saying is that it is human nature to want nice things and those nice things vary from person to person and from culture to culture so therefore it would probably be a bad idea to just try and come up with a system that deprives everyone of this basis Bic need there's also high-tech Goods so when you look at everything that goes into like your Xbox and your phone and and your VR goggles right like I was completely blown away because just the expansion for cyberpunk 2077 the Phantom Liberty expansion cost them $12 million to develop now obviously in the near future hopefully AGI makes it basically free to build any video game that you want but it's always possible that there are there's going to be some resources that go into these things whether energy raw materials uh compute time with the AGI because the AGI might not be free to run uh and so these high tech goods are always going to have some cost associated with them so I don't see getting away from any from from all currency because it's like hey well I built this thing and if you want it from me you need to trade something so if you if you forcibly get rid of money then you're still just going to end immediately get back to a barter system so you might as well have an abstract reserve of value so there are a lot of a lot of arguments to be made for keeping currency around and so then this goes back to what I was talking about which is prestige and wealth even with AGI uh like yes some people would like to kind of enforce their view of the world of an idealized form of humanity that doesn't have uh you know class and wealth and Prestige um but one thing that I want to point out is that I don't even know that people that want to get rid of that are in the in the majority I think that people that want to do away with um all wealth and Prestige and luxury are probably in the extreme minority maybe I'll run a poll for this um so basically a small minority wants to impose their will on the majority and that's just not how things work um now I I also had have had some discussions and some people want to check out of the system and I think that that's possibly going to be one of the options which is basically hey you can completely ignore the rat race particularly if we get to a a point where AGI is able to provide most goods and services that you need on a daily basis however you're not going to be able to enforce that on everyone nor would you want to and also the people with vested interest aren't going to allow you to do it so again whatever whatever uh an individual believes is the ideal way um it has to also be practical and feasible to get there and I just don't see it as happening now in the long run in the long long run I I don't mean like the next decade you know when we have early AGI I mean over the next Century over the next thousand years as we have AGI and more AGI and super intelligence I would not be surprised if we end up with entire uh generations of people that grow up and just don't care about money and so I think that we will adapt as a species over time but even in a million years well maybe a million years when we've completely evolved but over the next Century I don't think I don't see a compelling reason or path to getting rid of money so my person personal conclusion here's here's the long story short I don't think that we're going to see the abolition of currency I just don't see a good reason for it I don't see a good path um and I see a lot of arguments to the contrary I think we're going to stick around we're going to keep money for a lot of reasons I think that the money system could be better um as I pointed out there's you know the fact that money is weaponized right now through geopolitical tensions I think it's kind of dumb I think we need to evolve past that I think that we need to mature as a species and like get our act together and actually come together create uh several Global Reserve currencies that are more democratically uh implemented and controlled uh but we're ways off from that uh I do however see a drastically reduced role of currency in our day-to-day lives uh so basically you know I would not be surprised if you know 10 to 20 years from now hopefully sooner um but basically AGI and Hyper abundance are providing most of what we need on a day-to-day basis such that the cost of those those things becomes trivial so like you want to go to a restaurant you get your meal for free and it's a nice meal you want you want a decent house your house is for your first house is free um second house is you probably have to pay for this is actually something that we talked about in my Discord server was like yeah I I posted a video a while ago where I said like we could provide a free tiny house to everyone today and a lot of people are like I don't want a tiny house don't make me live in a pod and I'm like that's not the point the point is we have the technology to provide it for free today anyways my point now is that with AGI with Advanced robotics we can probably provide everyone a decent house for free uh in the in the relatively near future and that you would only need to pay for a second house in cash and again like how do you decide who gets which house if you want a luxury house you probably have to pay more for it you know there's a lot of lot of details to work out but the other point here is that money actually really helps you make those decisions because it's like you say hey I've accumulated $20,000 and I can trade this for you know a decent little cottage in the countryside or I can save up $20 million and get you know a Malibu house up to you however you want to spend it and so for for the sake of individual liberty I think that we probably need to keep money um and also for the sake of human nature we need to keep money but again I think that you know we're going to see a reduced use for money on a day-to-day basis anyways thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this um really enjoyed working with my patreon community in order to brainstorm this video and uh yeah like obviously um not everyone has to agree the future will play out how it plays out and uh I'll be curious to see which way it goes anyways thanks for watching like subscribe etc etc cheers
