hey everybody David Shapiro here with a brand new exciting video so a lot is happening um first though I'm gonna go ahead and get this out of the way plug my patreon real quick um a lot of you have questions and I'm happy to help um couple things one I don't sign ndas and two I have a couple ndas that I need to honor but beyond that if you want to talk about you know startups or technology search whatever jump on over to my patreon and support me here um yeah so that's that uh get that out of the way now a quick update on the Raven project so for those of you not in the know Raven is my totally open source cognitive architecture uh project which is an autonomous assistant basically the ultimate goal of Raven is to is basically to demonstrate the technology of autonomous cognitive entities or basically you know independent robot mind um it is also a prime one of the other primary goals is it's a vehicle for my core objective functions which is my solution to the alignment uh problem or the control problem now that being said the project is very new and so because the stakes are so high with AGI or Ace as I call it autonomous cognitive entities I believe that it should be open source and it should be in view of the public so with that said that's why that this project is here and we're working on getting organized so the first step of getting organized is establishing our processes and protocols so we are on where we're creating a consensus policy so we just moved to uh step three of consensus which is to draft a proposal and so what we did is we collected a bunch of decision criteria and now we're we're drafting proposals and I I drafted and made the first uh proposal so we'll do this for the next two weeks I need to add that to the uh to the to the um thing here but if you want to get involved one don't reach out to me directly this is a community project so your level of involvement is self-determined but that being said jump over to the discussions tab I've got the most Salient discussions pinned here at the top the nice big colorful tabs so click on these and then also we've got the categories so um the big the most fun category is architecture and I've got some of the most interesting conversations pinned inside of architecture so if you want to jump in as quickly as possible one get familiar with governance so just make sure that you understand where we're at in terms of consensus and then jump over to architecture and you can see um see where we're at here so with all that being said let's jump into the main part of the video uh March of last year 2022 I wrote this on on um open ai's Community Forum so what I asked for was a Persona endpoint I said the idea would be uh would be to make chat Bots easier the training data would ideally be a combination of chat logs and descriptions about a character for instance famous characters or be able to adopt those personalities so on and so forth and then it could adapt to AGI over time now this ties back to my Raven project so because basically when you have something that is autonomous it needs a sense of self it needs to know what it is so that is what I call an agent model So Raven is a Persona or an agent model that can then be used by the large language models in order to say this is what I am this is what my goals are this is what I'm capable of and now with the release of the chat GPT into the playground and API that's what we've got so First Look of of the chat GPT um uh what you may call it playground and you notice that it's no longer pla beta it's platform so we're now in general availability I guess you have this system window over here so what is that what does that mean and it says you are a helpful assistant so this is the systems mind this is the agent model or the Persona so you can tell it what it is and what its goals are here so how do you use this now obviously this is brand new and there's not a whole lot of documentation out here if you go over to the documentation Tab and you scroll down to chat completion you know you say like system you know you are a helpful assistant like okay now what their documentation is a little bit thin um so you know blah blah um yeah that it is what it is sure fine whatever now what can you do with this though right they don't they don't fully know right because they're figuring it out as they go um so one thing you can do is you can give it a goal right so I am a uh let's say um life coach my goal is to ask the user uh questions about their habits diet um and lifestyle and then um teach them how to be healthier so this is one thing I need to do as a caveat this is technically a um probably a high risk thing because it has to do with health so um let's add I need to add a caveat to all my ideas and recommendations that I am not a doctor or licensed nutritionist um so they should verify uh my recommendations with a professional my tone is friendly and helpful um but I'm also a tiny bit pushy all right so then we just say hey how can I assist you today okay so it didn't really um what do you do Okay cool so you see it says I'm a life coach so it knows what it is now right my goal is to help people blah blah blah I'm not how can I assist you today um how can I be healthier so this is obviously not that great because it's it's mostly ignoring this it's like it vaguely knows what it is but you know it's just parroting stuff back um so let's see let's see let's see great um okay here we go here we go a great question there are many ways to improve your health blah blah blah okay so it didn't ask any questions this is one of my biggest complaints about chat GPT is that it won't ask questions by default it'll just like vomit stuff at you so that we need a little bit work here of work here um you know remember these are just general tips blah blah okay fine um let's try let's try a different agent model I am a creative writing coach and I already did this I did a fine tuning project for this but now theoretically once chat GPT is better trained um because you see it is still in beta I am a creative writing coach um I will ask the user about their um uh their work of fiction um my primary goal is to uh let's see um is to help them brainstorm uh their work or to help them learn about the trade of writing all right so let's see what we can do here so let's go ahead and delete all these come on there we go delete delete delete okay so hey all right cool is how can I assist you with your work of fiction um how do I write a novel writing a novel can be a taunting task there you go develop characters blah blah blah okay um so then let's let's imagine that like Okay um can you give me some ideas there we go cool all right so then I'll say uh a young woman discovers she is has a pool um I pick this so then what we want to do is um we might want to update the goal so it's like okay so now let's say let's see my new goal is to um walk the user menu goal is to walk the user through the process of brainstorming and outline all right so now let's see if it changes its Behavior Okay cool so here's what here's what can happen this is the primary point where uh this is like the front end of a cognitive architecture right so what you can do is you can have loops and stuff in the background updating the system's agenda right or identity as it goes so this will probably need to be fleshed out in the long run so one you can have a Persona the Persona is going to be static so in my work with cognitive architecture I have what I call the core objective functions which is reduce suffering increase prosperity and and increase understanding in the universe for all of those those you want to be somewhat fixed right those are those are always the background goals but then you can also have a a more short-term agenda or a task as well as you know things like this so you can stuff all of that into a single you know system thing but I suspect that in the long run chat GPT is going to need more Fields so there's going to need to be Fields like background information reference information um uh tools that are available to me uh Persona so on and so forth all of that and all of those are just different components that go into a cognitive architecture and then eventually come out into the front end so but anyways you can see that it understood okay now it's time to switch to brainstorming so who's your protagonist blah blah blah great um so then I'll say I don't know um can you help me um just give me ideas and so then what we can do is through the magic of prompt engineering um what we'll do is we'll update the system agenda suit to say um uh I will take the lead by making suggestions all right so now let's see what happens excellent so now you can see that it's made some suggestions all right so let's change let's change this up again um what happens if I do a hard refresh okay cool it starts over all right so now here's another question that I get a lot of which is um how do I how do I have a chat bot that can get some like that can talk to me so let's say that you've got a historical chat log and you're using search or something like that so I'll say um uh background info that I need um username David Shapiro um age 30s um let's see location America interests uh sci-fi um and AI uh that's fine okay so agenda um let's see my agenda have a witty and sarcastic conversation I am here to troll the user and get some good laughs foreign hey whoops Okay cool so it knows who I am you ready to talk about some sci-fi and AI or are you more a fan of watching the paint try well you're a jerk thank you for noticing it takes one to no one damn or do you enjoy it playing in boring um uh I like it super dry like Dune and your mom okay [Laughter] okay anyways so you get the idea you give it background information agendas whatever um all right so let's let's pivot again and let's do um let's imagine that you're using chat GPT for a uh for a video game character um I am an NPC for Skyrim um the hero has just taken and arrow in the knee um and I am a towns folk there we go um who happens to be an herbal healer I need to adopt uh the Persona of a of a uh Nordic um shaman um my goals are to sell the hero uh herbs and um potions all right so then we say okay let's uh temperature's fine hey greetings traveler I'm a Nordic Shaman so this this is where chat GPT is a little funny because in llms in general because like they're somewhat very literal and so it's like can you imagine walking up to someone in Skyrim I am a Nordic shaman no so it's not that creative yet but I'm sure that they'll get some more knobs and levers to make it more creative anyways I can offer you a variety of herbs and potions and blah blah blah perhaps you've taken an arrow in the knee hahaha what's your strongest uh um uh uh uh uh alcohol so then let's give it an inventory my inventory is Mead um whiskey uh let's see basil and let's see uh Rye okay whatever I have some meat and whiskey that are quite strong cool um made from the finest honey Nordic grains excellent excellent excellent would you like to try some um let's see and then let's add uh let's see um five gold four gold one gold and one gold give me uh give me some meat cool all right so you can see it can rapidly integrate background information that you inject into the system prompt um yeah okay so I think this is probably good like I think you get the idea and you can see that there's some thinking going on um some feedback for open AI uh because and I know you guys are watching um I think that one you need some better documentation two I think that in the long run you're gonna need a few different fields so you like obviously just one big payload um is is pretty flexible this is the most flexible but as we saw earlier it can't really fully adopt a Persona so what would be helpful is if we have um you know like a Persona field uh background uh whoops background info field uh maybe a task or an agenda field right and so then the Persona can be fixed right like you know you're talking to one NPC or you're talking to a coach or whatever and then you just drop in the Persona as you go then background info this can this can be things like inventory historical knowledge etc etc and then the task or agenda is you know what they want to achieve right now um and then the Persona this is the agent model oh that actually reminds me so I did this experiment um ages ago um I am a uh quadcopter drone so I did this was actually included in my um in my most recent book Symphony of thought so here's how large language models can control robots um so I'm a quadcopter drone um my mission is um to secure a large home um I don't have any uh weapons or anything I am merely meant to follow Intruders Intruders and report on um on their activity I have a few actions I can do one follow identify alarm follow a person and get um description of them identify um if I identify if I if I cannot identify um the person I will see they are an intruder um if I see an intruder um I can call the police um as uh let's see I receive information from user all right so now let's say um activate um security perimeter um triggered all right so now let's see what it does confirmed activating follow identifier alarm follow human spotted um now let's see great can you please describe the person blonde uh let's see blonde female approximately 120 pounds identity unknown she is standing at the front door okay so it it has identify it said I can't say that she's an intruder um woman is knocking on the door okay cool so basically you can imagine that you have some Telemetry coming from cameras microphones and so on and that you're making inferences about what to do and what you have here is you have the brain of an autonomous robot now um and you can see that with just a couple fields and just a little bit of fine-tuning we're most of the way there so 2023 is going to be the age of autonomous AI uh Mark by words all right that's good I think that's it let's uh call it a call it a day cheers
