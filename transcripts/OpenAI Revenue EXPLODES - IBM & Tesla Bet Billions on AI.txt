good morning everybody David Shapiro here uh so in the last 24 hours we have seen several interesting pieces of news drop open AI Tesla and IBM are all throwing around numbers in the millions and billions and this is in terms of valuation revenue and investment so let's get right into it uh first up IBM has invested even more into hugging face so they have been involved with hugging face for instance they're collaborating on walks of Watson X however they just closed a series D funding round for 235 million dollars valuing hugging face at 4.5 billion dollars so this is a startup that produces primarily open source Ai and has only been around for what two years I think maybe three at least that's as long as like I've kind of known about them as as long as they've been on my radar now at the same time uh the CEO of IBM arvind Krishna has frozen thousands and thousands of jobs there's 3 900 more layoffs planned at IBM with 7 800 positions Frozen and this is also someone who has said that he expects 30 to 50 percent of repetitive tasks to be taken by Ai and that also uh that those back office tasks will probably be done better by AI so better faster cheaper uh in other words the takeaway IBM is doubling down on AI uh at the uh next up is Tesla so Tesla just fired up their uh high performance Computing cluster it's 300 worth 300 million dollars and it is built of 10 000 in video Nvidia h100 uh gpus uh so this is primarily going to be used to take on uh general purpose uh HPC workloads so this is an HPC compute cluster which basically means that it is a high performance tensor cores that you can use for anything now obviously Tesla they do a lot of AI but their their Flagship AI product is FSD which is full self driving uh Elon uh also said that they are going to invest four billion more dollars into AI over the next two years including at least a billion dollars into their Dojo supercomputer which is their primary training computer so again we see Tech Giants doubling down on AI with numbers in the hundreds of millions and billions of dollars and the uh kind of the the coup de grace of yesterday's news is that open ai's Revenue has exploded so last year they made 28 million dollars in revenue and in the next 12 months they're on track to make a billion dollars in Revenue uh their revenue has obviously exploded primarily due to chat GPT and having more than 100 million users sign up in two months but one thing that you need to keep in mind is that this is a 35x increase in Revenue growth so this is where uh tech companies really aim for to be like a true uh unicorn um so the the technical definition of unicorn is any tech company that any Tech startup that gets to a billion dollar valuation but what the next phase that you're looking for is for them to to take off exponentially so this is the nature of the book exponential organizations which I bought but I haven't fully read yet uh anyways the idea is that because of the nature of Technology because user adoption can be that fast because you can immediately have Global exposure once your product uh hits the market that's how you can have 35x Revenue growth in Tech and in literally no other industry because in in most other Industries where there is human labor involved and when there as physical goods and locations involved it's just not possible to grow that fast uh one part of the reports out there says that uh the chat GPT costs them seven hundred thousand dollars per day to run and if you do the math I did some some quick back of the napkin calculations um if if chat GPT costs 700 000 a day to run then you add it all up and you look at a billion dollars Revenue it probably costs Chad gbt at current rates about 250 to 300 million dollars per year to run so if they're if their revenue is 1 billion but the outflows just from running chat GPT which again right now is their Flagship product um then that means they still have 700 million dollars left over for things like uh employee revenue or employee salaries research that sort of stuff now another thing to make this more complicated is that because of the deal that openai signed with Microsoft um I obviously like I haven't read the the entire full package of their deal but my understanding is that Microsoft is entitled to up to 75 percent of open ai's Revenue until they reached a threshold and I think that that threshold is until openai earns them a hundred billion dollars so originally as of last year it they thought that it could take a decade or more to pay it off now given this recent news and the explosion uh maybe that time frame will shorten now obviously a billion dollars in Revenue if they're giving less than that to Microsoft that's still going to be like 100 years so if their revenue uh increases to 10 billion a year or something like that then they'll be able to pay it off even faster again I'm not sure of all the all the full terms but my point here is that Microsoft is benefiting from their investment now I don't know if the whole thing is Cash positive open AI might still be losing money they certainly were last year Microsoft might still be losing money on the deal but what they're doing is these are strategic moves that the companies are doing in order to better position themselves as these Technologies ramp up okay so that's the three pieces of news let's dive into the analysis first is uh data and metrics and predictions on investment growth so when you see numbers like this you know 235 million 300 million uh a billion dollars that is really interesting because this is kind of I'm not going to say it's the first time we're seeing numbers this big but we're certainly seeing numbers this big uh in much shorter periods of time and so this uh made me like look into like okay what did what did the financial analysts predict and it looks like we're actually kind of on track so yes these are like exciting numbers but Goldman Sachs forecasted last year that by 2025 we should be seeing 200 billion dollars per year in these kinds of AI Investments uh which is double what it was more than double what it was last year of 92 billion uh there is some evidence that that 2023 might be seeing a Slowdown um but there's also some evidence that it might be accelerating so we're not really going to know until the year is oh over and we've had a chance to tally it all up but right now the general consensus seems to be that things are chugging along more or less as expected so keep that nut keep these numbers in mind that like yes the growth is explosive here so it's a really good time to be selling AI uh Goods Services Hardware software that sort of stuff because the investment is coming the investment is growing and so what all these moves that we're seeing are just naturally to be expected because if we go from 66 billion to 92 billion one year and then we go from 92 billion to let's say 120 billion this year that's 30 billion more dollars that's going to be thrown around on top of what was thrown around last year so the investment is happening we're seeing this exponential ramp up I guess this is more of a geometric ramp up rather adding about 30 billion dollars per year of investment um to to uh AI resources so we're seeing this geometric ramp up um but we're not talking in the millions of dollars we're talking in the billions and very soon hundreds of billions of dollars which means that any problems that AI has are going to be solved and this goes back to my video a few weeks ago AI winter is not coming this is more evidence that AI winter is not coming so do not think about AI as it is today think about AI as it will be a year from now because remember this time last year none of you knew well I'm not going to say none of you some of some of my longtime fans will remember when it was just gpt3 because that's all we have this time last year uh but then uh you know come November chat GPT came out and everything changed so imagine where we're going to be this time next year now on top of investment you know I'm always I'm one of the ones that's always beating the drum on you know post labor economics and you know utopian future where nobody has to work so I decided to put my money or numbers rather where my mouth is and I looked it up so I use perplexity to find all kinds of Statistics from various dimensions and angles and so yes there have been 150 000 or more U.S tech layoffs as of June so that's that's excluding July and now August so there's two more months however the recent data shows that total unemployment in America remains at a relatively low 3.5 percent uh there was 375 000 tech jobs open uh as of January this year obviously that's probably changed a little bit uh forecasts uh at uh at the same time showed that they were expecting 272 000 more new tech jobs by the end of 2023. so that remains to be seen those last two sources were not government sources um those were like from zip recruiter and stuff like that so take those with a grain of salt but the layoffs that was government data so that's that's pretty reliable data uh some other non-governmental sources uh said that AI is expected to uh to destroy 85 million jobs globally by 2025 but is expected to create up to 97 million jobs globally by 2025 so that would be a net gain of 12 million jobs and so when you see the layoffs and new jobs that are going unfulfilled uh there's a trend emerging here which is that old jobs are going away and new jobs are being created again many of these sources are not government a lot of them are speculation and forecasting so take it with a grain of salt but the pattern to me seems relatively clear and that is that we are going through a Workforce transformation so it is time to skill up uh another piece of evidence in this puzzle is that generative AI job postings jumped 20 in May alone or maybe that was year over year I don't remember uh anyways you know so post-labor economics not here yet but uh there is evidence that you need to be pivoting to uh generative AI skills and tools so if you're not you're going to get further and further behind uh now this this slide was actually the most interesting thing to me because you know I talked to some of my fellow communicators and YouTubers and researchers I talk to people all over the world and so if you talk to individuals and figure out what their concerns are you know like government policy makers trying to get you know other people in the government on board with AI or uh Business Leaders trying to figure out how to adopt AI uh the numbers of public sentiment were actually more where I was hoping they would be which kind of invalidated some of the work that I've done but hey this is a good place for me to be wrong so let me dive into the data a Reuters ipsis poll recently showed that 61 of Americans view AI as a Potential Threat to human civilization that is a huge that is almost a super majority already of Americans that say yes AI could wipe us all out so thanks to James Cameron and the Matrix and and all that other you know every story out there we have a schema those those fictional stories have done their job to prepare us for the potential dangers of AI uh the next piece of information is that a Pew research poll showed that 58 of Americans are more concerned than excited about the rise of AI in daily life so again there's a little bit of anxiety and consternation rather than just raw excitement so I'm not saying that like the doomers are winning I'm just saying that like there's people are are cautious uh and then this one was Far and Away the most interesting which was an economist and you gov poll showed that about 75 percent of Americans believe that AI should be regulated or heavily regulated by the government that 79 percent Democrat and 73 Republicans we rarely ever see this much consensus on anything in America but when you you have either a majority near super majority or above super majority of Americans agreeing on something the political willpower is there so this gives me a tremendous amount of confidence that regulations are going to happen that people are taking it seriously and that this will help steer the ship in the right direction so I wanted to share this information with you because to me it gave me a lot of confidence that we're heading in the right direction all right so some conclusions and takeaways here's my predictions uh AI investment May cool slightly and I don't mean that it's going to go down I just mean it's going to slow down so it's not going to go negative it's just it's not going to be quite as hot as it has been and my interpretation is that the several class action lawsuits filed against open AI have kind of spooked the markets and maybe made people a little bit more tepid about jumping in now that being said we just did see you know a lot of investment yesterday so we'll see Meta has been taking an entirely different approach to AI where they're just doing everything open source it's a bold strategy we'll see how it plays out uh so stay tuned on the space of closed Source versus open source personally I think that open source is the way just because it's going to have less friction and it's going to have more collaboration which means that any AI built on open source data and open source models are probably just going to be better not the least of which they're going to be more democratic that's my hope uh let's see number two Americans are largely United on regulations and fears but regulatory capture is still a primary concern with regulation comes risk because if you regulate it incorrectly if you listen to the wrong people when you're coming up with regulations uh then you know every every stakeholder is going to try and stack the regulations in their favor so stacking the deck in their favor whether it's big companies whether it's governments uh or whoever whatever other special interests or lobbyists are out there um that's that's the primary concern now the amount of attention that Americans are putting on AI I think means that that that's gonna we're gonna demand transparency and we're going to demand accountability so my hope is that this is something that we're going to do right and probably what I'll do is because there's so much consensus on this I'll do a follow-up video on how do we do AI regulation correctly so that we don't end up with regulatory capture uh and finally the state of jobs right now seems really good so uh you know post labor economics and Ubi are going to have to wait for a while like I said in a previous video where I introduced these Concepts there's a few signals that we can pay attention to such as deflation jobs loss and a few other things um we're still in a state of inflation and we're still in a state of low unemployment so post-labor economics it's on the horizon will it but it also remains to be seen because again I could be completely wrong in reading the tea leaves um now that being said there are many industries that are actively being disrupted by uh by Tech if you look on on Reddit across many different domains tech jobs are being disrupted marketing jobs translation jobs that was an interesting one that I just saw yesterday where someone was talking about uh people in the translation industry are just expecting to be pretty much out of work by this time next year copywriting has already been under threat and so what I'm curious is as AI destroys like pretty much entire segments of the of the labor market are we going to see a commensurate number of new jobs popping up elsewhere I don't know that that's the case and because it's difficult to see on aggregate how many jobs have been lost to AI versus created all we have is base all we have to go on is basically total employment numbers and total unemployment rates okay so what are the two primary takeaways number one skill up uh we are actively um in a state of job market transformation um so this is something where I actually can help you out um I have a consultation I do uh whether it's training product design whatever uh I do it all remotely I don't do it in person just because traveling is too difficult for me but this whole phase reminds me of the early 2000s with the rise of Microsoft and it and developer certifications uh it was all the rage and there was literally ad like lots of advertisements saying like there are sixty thousand unfilled IT jobs you know get training now and that's actually how I picked my career was because at the time I was like okay well I need a job I'm good at technology and there's unmet demand so I think we're about to see the same kind of explosion in unmet demand in generative AI jobs so skill up I'm probably going to work with some people to develop some some actual training material so stay tuned for that because hey if I can help people transition and survive at least for the next five years again I don't know what's going to happen long term 5 10 20 years we might be pivoting to post labor economics we might not like I said I could be completely wrong about that but a lot of people that I talk to in government in research and health care and other places a lot of people do agree with me that we were probably heading towards post-labor economics eventually we just don't really know when right now General consensus seems to be people are saying like five to ten years and that by 20 years we should probably have made the transition again predictions you know take it with a grain of salt and then finally voter solidarity like I said we rarely see this much uh consensus but that means that we need to demand we need to use that consensus to demand transparency and demand accountability so don't count your chickens before they hatch and maintain a sense of constant vigilance thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this video like subscribe share and consider hopping over on patreon if you want to jump into any upskilling training or Direction on that respect thanks have a good one
