hello everybody David Shapiro here with a brand new video today's video by popular demand is about post-labor economics what happens when AI changes work forever real quick before we jump into the show I just want to plug my patreon real quick I have a private Discord server for all patreon supporters and I do also have several other Discord servers that I am a part of one is the gato community and the other is the cognitive AI lab Discord which I started at the beginning of my YouTube career so anyways hop on over to patreon if you want to support me get involved in the private conversations I also have a few higher tier slots available where I have exclusive access one-on-ones group Chats on patreon and on um calendly so on with the show in order to talk about post labor economics we need to start by talking about the history of labor-based Economics for the majority of human history human labor and our energetic output the physical force that we can apply on the world has been the biggest driver of productivity this was 100 True for our oldest ancestors hunter-gatherers who had not yet figured out how to harness energy and nature or the energy of animals it became slightly less true for our agrarian ancestors as they started to use draft animals such as Horses and Ox as well as basic machines like water wheels and levers and carts now granted a lever and a cart don't actually add energy to the equation but they do allow you to multiply your own Force the Industrial Revolution happened which of course everyone talks about that because we're in the midst of the fourth Industrial Revolution was primarily about Force amplification or Force multiplication so in other words we started inventing machines that could use thermal energy from various fuel sources such as coal and oil and they were able to Output more energy or more work than we could with just our muscles and certainly more than even large animals could another advantage of machines is that they could metabolize fuel at a far higher rate so say for instance a gallon of gasoline a gallon of gasoline has about 31 000 calories of energy in it which is about how much I eat in 10 days but a large machine can use that gallon of gasoline in a matter of minutes or hours depending on what that machine is doing such as if it's a large tractor or combine that's being used to manage a farm for instance and so not just a mat the amount of work that can be done but the amount of energy that can be used was the big game changing factor for the Industrial Revolution but as everyone knows a tractor is not particularly smart it pulls something it's not any different than what a human can do or an ox it's just bigger faster and stronger so that is where uh the industrial Revelation Revolution sorry Revelation the Industrial Revolution changed labor-based Econo economics but you still needed an intelligent human driving that tractor now the industrial revolution of course is a Marvel of mechanical engineering metal metal Sciences electronics and so on but one thing that we need to point out that is critical is that it all still comes down to the application and use of energy so human population growth over the last two centuries has been tied directly to the amount of energy we had access to because that also is directly correlated to the amount of food we can produce the amount of water we can um transport and clean and drink and so basically uh what I want to do here is point out that yes labor is about what humans can do with our hands our bodies and what we can do with the use of machines but we're also still completely dependent upon the underlying sources of energy so this is an important thing to keep in mind in the long history of labor and moving up through to today there's a few basic kinds of Labor and of course I'm not going to get into every little Nuance or detail but there's three overarching categories of Labor so first is manual unskilled labor this includes moving heavy things using your hands and body uh that doesn't basically something that you can pick up in an afternoon so for instance one of the jobs that I had when I was much younger was I was restocking the shelves at a pet store at night didn't take a whole lot of brains took a lot of muscles moving heavy things put here you know object a in place B repeat then the next level above that is skilled labor so this is crafts such as carpentry um electrical work Plumbing that sort of thing this also could include uh hospitality and food service because it's still very kinetic it's still very much oriented in your body but these are things that require training some of them require certification but they one thing that they all almost always have in common is that it requires you to use tools and materials when you're doing skilled labor now there are jobs such as being a doctor or a nurse that are also very kinetic but those uh require years and years and years of training and certification and so those um while they are still embodied work um they are still professions or knowledge work and so then that leads to the third category which is professional labor or knowledge work which includes things like Architects lawyers doctors things that you do on computers even being an influencer technically could be considered a profession depending on the kind of influencer you are right but one rule of thumb is that you do it in a desk or in an office or in front of a computer and again this is not always true key example being medical professionals who many of whom interact with people all day every day and it requires a tremendous amount of training excuse me ditto for uh for uh trial lawyers right trial lawyers have to do a lot of office work but they also have to go to trial to go to court before judges and so on magistrates so one thing that I need to point out though is that we have transitioned largely from a unskilled labor and skilled labor economy to a knowledge-based economy or a services-based economy so this is one of my favorite graphs of all time and many people are shocked when I tell them about this so there's a few things to unpack here so there's a couple of trend lines this solid green trend line is the agricultural uh share of total employment so basically what has happened is that as uh as time has progressed the number of farm jobs has collapsed to around two percent of total employment and it was much much much higher this was if I'm reading this correctly I believe it was over 30 percent just over 100 years ago so from 30 percent of jobs were farm jobs to around two percent and then this dotted green axis is non-agricultural employment the left axis um all right right Axis so that's this is percentage yes and then the left axis is over here so the total uh number of employees that were not uh Farm employees has gone up from around 20 million now also keep in mind that the population was growing at the same time but from 20 million to over 140 million non-farm jobs and then finally agriculture employment um has collapsed from around uh let's say about 10 to 12 million jobs total to almost non-existent in terms of total number of employees so this shows how just a single sector farming has completely been changed over the years largely just due to Industrial Automation through tractors combines and economies of scale with mechanized farming and this is just one sector so what people are hoping is that today all the service jobs that we all hate all the all the BS jobs the desk jobs that we hate today are going to follow this trend line the way that Farms have jobs have gone but then there's going to be entirely new categories of jobs that come up now as many of you know I'm rather skeptical of this um certainly it would be an interesting future if there's entirely if there's millions and millions or even billions of new jobs created by AI I am skeptical that this is going to be the outcome and let me tell you why knowledge work or service sector jobs are uh rooted in what's called cognitive labor or knowledge work so as farm jobs have been crashing knowledge work has been rising so the majority of work today is knowledge work or cognitive labor this could also be argue arguably included emotional labor so emotional labor is a form of cognitive labor that is more common in nurturing and caregiving roles tools like chat GPT and its successors are going to continue to invade the domain of cognitive labor so we've already seen some examples of chat GPT used for tutoring used for medical advice used for relationship advice people have even automated companies you know the automatic CEO thing so it is pretty obvious to everyone by now that these models that chat GPT gpt4 and so on are capable of cognitive labor it would be pretty silly to assume that this does not continue so that leaves physical labor skilled labor unskilled labor and cognitive later labor but if AI is invading cognitive labor first what are we gonna do we go back to manual labor do we all pick up arts and crafts and others semi-skilled and skilled labor you know it's not necessarily what I want to do right if there is a a future state where I'm not going to get paid by anyone but an AI is going to come through and you know basically take my YouTube gig from me right like I don't want to go back to shoveling dirt and anyways there's machines that are better at it than humans so why would I do that so when you when you look at those three categories skilled unskilled and cognitive labor and you say okay well machines are better stronger and faster and cheaper at all of those than humans and they're only getting better that leaves the question what are we going to do so as I was trying to figure out like just trying to find a way to do this it occurred to me that looking at this from supply side or capability of AI versus Humans might not be the right way to look at it so there's the other way to look at it is demand side so what kind of jobs will people demand or want humans to have specifically in many cases you might want a you might always prefer to have a human doing something like Child Care Hospitality sorry hospitality jobs and other performance oriented things such as influencers right I don't know about you but every time I find a video that has you know an AI face AI voice I click off of it I don't want you know smoke and mirror I don't want to be lectured at by a sock puppet I want to see a real human I want to see their uh facial expression their intonation and I want to develop a parasocial relationship with the people that I follow and so a parasocial relationship is what most of you have with me where you have in your mind a model of me and like you kind of understand where I'm coming from right uh even though I might not know necessarily know all of you I in fact I don't know most of you but the uh the desire for that parasocial relationship for that um that that connection that human connection is something that I suspect that most humans are gonna want no matter how good AI gets now that being said there are probably going to be people that are like you know what I don't really care about people I you know just give me the information just give me the entertainment that's fine so this leads one final question will there be enough of those human exclusive jobs to go around I don't think there will be uh sure we might be able to have some Back to Basics moments where it's like oh hey you know maybe we can spend more time with our families maybe we can spend more time with child care and education that's not enough to drive the whole economy and it's certainly not enough I don't think for everyone to have a meaningful career especially if your interests lie elsewhere that just doesn't sound good so now I will introduce you to what I call Post labor economics and I apologize for the wall of text on this uh slide but I figured just a list you can pause it and read it in much greater detail if you'd like but I'll just go uh just read the bullet points at the high level so automation dominance this is the idea that Automation in the form of Robotics Ai and other kinds of automation is going to take over including for cognitive labor the second aspect of post-labor Economics is the decreased economic value of human labor basically humans can't compete on an economic scale to tractors why do you expect that humans are going to get be able to compete on an economic scale to AI as its intelligence ramps up number three another criteria or uh characteristic of post-labor Economics is that we will probably see redistributive policies so redistribution is not necessarily a collective ownership I'm not advocating for socialism basically all I'm advocating for is some form of universal basic income or reverse income tax or that kind of thing or negative income tax sorry ownership shifts so this is where this is the closest thing to Socialism or Marxism that I will ever talk about um because I I do not believe in central management of the economy I don't think that it's a good idea um I do believe in kind of the wisdom of of Market forces but what I do anticipate is that the ownership class might shift and we might shift more towards decentralized ownership models or Collective ownership models such as co-ops and this is not something that I invented these are things that exist today but with the aid of AI it might be easier for ordinary people to band together to collectively buy resources property and other capital goods that allow them to be to participate in the means of production now I'm not going to say that this is going to totally replace all corporations but if we can stick The Landing with Technologies like blockchain and decentralized autonomous organizations then we can have expert you know AI CEOs managing our resources for us another component of post labor economics I suspect will be price deflation and so what I mean by this is that as AI gets better at producing more goods and services the marginal cost of those goods and services is going to collapse and it's not all goods and services some things are going to remain expensive or at least more expensive than others but other things are going to get very very cheap and I'll go into some details in just a moment we're also going to need new economic indicators so what I mean by this is that GDP sorry GDP and employment rates I tried to say both of those at the same time unemployment rates are not going to be quite as meaningful in the future as they are today right now total employment and unemployment rates are really important indicators for how well the economy is doing but in a post-labor economy employment rate won't matter as much so we might need other other metrics in order to measure how well the economy is doing there's probably also going to be changes in consumption patterns so for instance we're going to have more Leisure Time and less requirement to work and so that means that we'll probably change where we live how we eat um access to other services like healthcare will probably decline because we'll be living healthier lives I hope uh and so on and so forth uh one of the toughest nuts to crack is actually going to be item number eight here which is reshaping our identity and self-worth and we have actually a few slides dedicated to this coming right up and then finally number nine is regulatory changes that will basically have to be addressed as we transition from a human labor economy to a post-labor economy okay so let's unpack these I mentioned the ownership of production so this basic question is who owns the machines who owns the the means of production so if things continue the way that they are we run the risk of continued trends of capital concentration and or regulatory capture so regulatory capture is what everyone is afraid of with companies calling for regulation of AI because it's like okay well if only a few players are allowed to participate then by virtue of everyone else getting regulated out of existence only the top players are allowed to play that would probably be problematic for the rest of us now as I mentioned I'm not going to advocate for Marxism or Socialism or anything like that I'm not saying that we should collectively seize the means of production uh the reason being that market forces still work in centralized management uh pretty much never works at least not a full-scale national levels uh we will need more sophisticated models of uh ownership than exists today so for instance um you know as I mentioned uh co-ops Collective ownerships I've got a few examples in the next slide I believe but otherwise if corporate payrolls shrink and many of us lose jobs how then are we going to redistribute uh the the benefits obtained by the Technologies who's going to reap the rewards so one component of that is robust redistribution so whether or not we change ownership because obviously many people will still kind of have the idea of the value of private property and that sort of thing and certainly I think that private property is going to exist that being said not everyone is going to be a landowner right not everyone is going to own a robot Factory or or anything like that so we're going to need to have some kind of robust redistribution policy so that could come in the form of universal basic income or more sophisticated models and I always liken it to a hydrological cycle so money like water tends to flow towards some kind of accumulator now in our world those accumulators tend to be Federal governments and the capitalist class in form of shareholders and corporations so money tends to flow in those two polar directions and so then redistribution comes in the form of uh you know government handouts government subsidies that sort of thing and taxes right some being skimmed off the top of corporations in order to go to the government and then to be redistributed so the idea here is then you need a policy that uh basically makes it rain right you want it to rain a certain amount in every region and you want it to rain fairly you don't want too much rain because that's inflation and that's bad and you don't want too little rain because that's deflation and that's also bad so the idea is that these future redistributive policies need to distribute the the money like the water evenly fairly and uh in a controlled policy so this is uh not exactly your grandpa's trickle-down economics Theory uh I mentioned Collective ownership and there are a few examples of collective ownership out there now granted none of these are global scale but we've got a long time before we need to worry about global scale redistribution some of them are national scale uh which is a good thing but of course um Norway is not as big as America uh so there's a few examples so one is the Alaska Permanent Fund which is basically that uh pretty much every every Alaskan gets a annual check for Collective ownership of the oil reserves in Alaska the Norwegian Sovereign wealth fund pretty much the same thing but for all citizens of Norway and it is a trust fund that is used to fund public services and it is funded by their oil reserves the mon Dragon Corporation is an owner-operated Corporation in Spain and then the Green Bay Packers are uh NFL team that is unique among the NFL that is collectively owned by 360 000 shareholders so on the topic of collective ownership and redistribution Sam Altman does want to do something uh in in line of this basically saying if openai owns the means of production AKA gbt4 5 6 and 7 and whatever other Downstream models they come up with he has explicitly said that he wants to kind of create a trust fund of sorts that is then used to distribute that uh that surplus of wealth and this is part of one of his ideas which is World coin now what I will say is that I'm not sure that this entire project should be piloted and mediated by a Silicon Valley CEO Silicon Valley CEOs don't exactly have a good track record in terms of being fair and not allowing power to corrupt them over time now this is not a personal indictment of Sam Altman I very much often agree with what he says but that being said he is in a position of a lot of privilege and power and so therefore should be scrutinized there should we should should engage with a healthy level of skepticism and I have a feeling that he would invite that healthy skepticism as well but again I don't disagree with the sentiment were I in his place I would probably be trying to do the same exact thing um but again actions speak louder than words so another thing is that Collective ownership doesn't necessarily have to happen on a national scale or a state scale it can happen on uh local scales and does in the form of land trusts so there are plenty of examples of collective ownership that exists today now one thing that is uh kind of the primary let's say primary complaint that I get when I talk about redistributive policies such as universal basic income which is what about inflation so there is some some Merit to this idea so redistribution such as universal basic income can actually be a force for inflation we did see a small but not negligible effect from the stimulus checks here in America that caused some of the inflation now I will say that aggregate supply and aggregate demand and other supply chain issues are far larger effects of the current inflationary uh Paradigm that we're seeing that being said the stimulus checks did cause some inflation because they uh created higher aggregate demand which is basically that consumers overall have more money to spend therefore prices go up another thing that can drive inflation is inelastic supply so as Global wealth goes up due to AI as more productivity goes up and demand goes up broadly there are going to be goods and services and other supplies that do not scale so for instance one of the most limited resources on the planet is Rare Minerals like lithium and Cobalt no amount of AI is going to make there be more Ai and Cobalt unless of course it can dig deeper into the Earth's crust or go to saddle asteroids and mine them there which is entirely possible I did mention that in a previous video as one of the possible solutions to Mineral scarcity that being said there's only ever going to be so much desirable beachfront property in Monaco right um so there's there's going to be some kind of scarcity that we cannot overcome no matter how much cognitive Surplus that we have now all that being said there will be some inflationary pressures that we can't really get rid of but I think that in the long run they are going to be offset by and large by some really profound and strong deflationary pressures so for instance a deflationary pressure is something that lowers prices so the job loss that I am anticipating from AI is going to reduce consumer demand until that is somehow fixed or replaced because with job losses people are going to hoard their money A little bit more we saw this happen during the pandemic for instance where people spent a lot less money because it was a time of uncertainty if you lose your job as many people in some of the communities that I'm a part of have been laid off as part of the tech layoffs they don't know if or when they're ever going to get a job again like that's a pretty profound thing so job loss results in deflationary pressure because people are spending money less and driving demand down in fact one of the things that my wife and I are doing is we're going to be downsizing right rather than having a house payment we're going to move to a smaller house that we can fully pay off Market saturation is another deflationary pressure so for instance I did mention earlier that some goods and services will continue to go down in price one personal example that I have is that the first time I had my novel professionally edited I spent Seventeen hundred dollars to have a world-class professional editor take a look at my novel after I got that feedback uh from her I then not long after that I got access to gpt4 which has a much larger context window and I was able to uh pretty much get developmental feedback or um or line editing feedback on the entire thing for less than 17 twice so that is a 100x drop in price and it's really difficult for people to wrap their heads around the possibility that many goods and services are going to be a thousand X cheaper or 10 000 X cheaper in the coming years so this downward pressure due to the the abundance of AI is going to be something that is kind of like a default raise for everyone if it works out that way so in the case of medicine or the total cost of Health Care in America is 4.3 trillion dollars per year imagine if within a few years AI is able to reduce the total cost of Health Care in America by a factor of a hundred I know that this sounds completely ludicrous and it probably will take a little bit longer than a few years because the medical establishment is very slow very onerous and does not is very resistant to change but imagine if your health care costs whatever they were last year if you spend you know a few hundred dollars on a couple medications and one trip to the doctor or if you have chronic conditions that require a lot of medications and a lot of tests and you spend you know five thousand dollars imagine if you only had to spend fifty dollars last year instead of five thousand and that's not with uh with you know socialist policies or um or single-payer systems where the government foots the bill I'm talking about the actual cost of Health Care could collapse that much in the long run due to Ai and so that is a tremendous deflationary pressure so basically deflation means that your dollar goes much farther another thing to consider is that in many cases there are elastic supplies so imagine the knock-on effects of AI enhancing everything from Supply chains at every level reducing the need for middlemen reducing the need for humans and human labor which is really expensive so all the goods and services that you get even if an AI is not directly used in creating that final good or service it's still going to help the entire process which means that the entire economy is going to be a lot more elastic which will also drive down prices now we get to the hardest part of all of this the rest I think is going to happen no matter what we do right there is just so much economic incentive to drive down prices because that's what capitalism does right it seeks efficiency when it's working well it doesn't always work well so I'll throw I'll throw that caveat out now that being said the inevitable conclusion of all this seems to be that we are going to arrive at a situation where most of us are going to be looking in the rear view mirror and say bye job right like our conventional jobs are going to go the way of the dinosaurs and so one of the most common sentiments that I get and it's always worded slightly different but the their permutations of this thing which is I would rather die than live on government handouts this happens more often than not there are numerous reasons for this feeling and it is important to consider because what else is the point of being alive excuse me so there are cultural reasons ethical reasons religion spirituality and even familial history identity gender Norms um all kinds of stuff will push people to identify with their job or to really value their self-sufficiency right self-sufficiency rugged individualism self-reliance that sort of thing these beliefs come from numerous places whether it's you know the culture particularly here in America in many families like you're not considered a real man unless you're a provider right for particularly for men you might expect yourself and be expected to be the primary Breadwinner careers also do a lot for our sense of purpose our sense of excellence and confidence a career is a good source of challenge it's a good way to feel good about yourself like you've done something and then for even people that are not men Independence is often predicated on the ability to make ends meet and so what I mean by this is that if you need to get away from your family or a toxic friend group or whatever if you need to stay out of prison because you need to stay away you know from the street you might need that good job and so if you don't have that good job you might be forced to back into a bad situation so there's a lot of reasons that people are afraid of not having their job so what I've been able to identify is that after talking with some of these people and and thinking through it is there's two primary threads here one is what if I can't take care of myself and the people that I care about that's really the core fear at least one of them another one is another core fear is what if my sense of agency and autonomy is taken from me what if I am just subservient to the whims of the government right so one of the potential solutions to this is a concept from ancient Greece called erete which is Excellence or the pursuit of Excellence so in this case the ability to feel competent about something in order to feel a sense of Mastery and challenge this is a um this is a a social phenomenon um that was based on social reward and social incentive even if there was no Financial reward so what I mean by this is that uh particularly in uh the elite classes like aristocracy and capitalist class and owner class the the individual behaviors the individual sense of competence and achievement didn't necessarily come from a career it came from other achievements whether they were academic achievements participating in public life having a good family so on and so forth or even independent competitions right playing Polo and Yacht racing and all the other stuff that rich people do for fun and for challenge you know they do martial arts they um they go on adventures and so on and so forth the acquisition of status symbols is part of that sense of Excellence but there are plenty of other ways to achieve excellence so uh other aspects of pursuing the pursuit of Excellence include that Mastery that social recognition right in many cases it's a matter of achieving that um that status in the eyes of the people that you care about for instance going back to that idea of being a breadwinner that head of household recognition the recognition that you are a good man who takes care of his family or that you're a good mother who takes care of his family or you know whatever it happens to be there are other ways to Signal tribal belonging for instance think about all the guys that go to you know watch the game together at the bar that is something that gives them a sense of belonging and even a sense of Excellence if your team wins you feel uh like you have benefited from that confidence and all of this is possible without a conventional career now that being said I will say that it does take time to adapt I know this personally because I left my conventional career just earlier this year and I kind of floundered around for a while it was weird right and I still struggled with finding okay how is it that I can feel productive how is it that I can feel meaningful and valuable and so those metrics change right now it's a matter of how many views my videos get now it's a matter of what we talk about when I go to the meetups that I host and that sort of thing um now that being said I will say that without a conventional career uh finding something to be proud of Mastery challenged all of that uh still exists and it's still a need too one example is I picked up a Guitar so when I had my camera moved you probably saw that I had a guitar in the background that is a very fancy nice guitar that I have not yet learned to use that A friend gave to me many years ago I got a very simple guitar that has only three strings to start learning on um but my point is is that you know one of my dreams for myself is that I will one day learn how to play guitar and I can sit around the campfire and play guitar and sing with my friends and that is going to be something that I can derive a sense of Excellence or a sense of Mastery from might never get there because I am both tone deaf and I have awful timing so you know uh anyways I wanted to close this with physical fitness is one of the most familiar models that people have with a pursuing Excellence we all know a bunch of Jim Bros and Gym Rats who really Bank a lot of their pride and their ego on looking good and feeling good and being fit and looking sexy right that is a model that everyone has a lot of people do this and it's not for financial gain it is purely for the pursuit of excellence and so you take that gym model and there's all kinds of other stuff you can do with that a lot of my friends are Gamers and they and some of them even game competitively same exact need being met is you get that challenge you get the reward of winning or otherwise getting recognition for Your Excellence now the other part and this is actually a little bit harder to address is autonomy self-determination losing your autonomy is a major cause of burnout which is true for me you can check out a video on my other channel talking about burnout it's also a cause of rebellion and despair so in many cases around the world win Rebellion has happened it is because the citizenry lost their sense of autonomy either due to oppression or just economic collapse and they said okay we're not really happy with this we're going to take the power back so this is a legitimate fear and let me underscore why if the jobs go away which I predict they will then your money goes away and particularly in America your personal autonomy is directly tied to your wallet your financial power is this is and this is actually an explicit policy of neoliberal societies is it is it the freedom in the neoliberal society is freedom to spend money however you choose but this has the the uh the dark side of that is that if you don't have money you're not free which everyone knows that in America right this is something that uh people have said like oh you know you're only as free as your dollar right so this is not a new phenomenon and this is why people are afraid of AI ultimately taking their jobs at least one of the reasons um this is a very powerful incentive and I've actually had conversations over many many years particularly with conservatives that they say that this is actually a very deliberate policy in order to motivate people to work harder and the idea is that the fear of not having money and the fear of losing your freedom is a powerful motivating factor and of course this is the de facto policy of America for several decades um and it's taken even further because part of that fear part of the part of the motivating people away from poverty is that poverty is something to be ashamed of particularly in America poverty or being poor is seen as a moral failing or even a sin that if you're poor not only do you deserve it but it's your fault because you're a bad person and in this case the the more money you have the more free you are but also the more virtuous or righteous you are and this goes back to our Protestant and Puritan Roots so personal agency or self-determination or autonomy is inextricably tied to your financial power this is a very problematic mentality and I'm not saying that like if you feel this way it's it's not your fault I'm saying that like the fact that this exists in our Zeitgeist is that's that's the problem now with post-labor economics this is my hope and dream is that with post-labor economics if optimal redistributions remember the idea of the rain clouds dropping rain everywhere if optimal redistribution is achieved then our individual autonomy should increase so what I mean by this is that first abundance of free time imagine that your need for for working a day job goes away so suddenly you have 40 hours of per week back that's all yours so free time is one component of autonomy the other thing is the decrease in cost that we talk about so if a lot of goods and services go down in price then whatever money you do have is actually going to take you further so basically your financial power is effectively increased even if you don't make as much money now that being said the biggest problem the elephant in the room for all this is that trust in the American system is low the government has a poor track record of sticking the landing on these kinds of things and this is not something that you and I can fix this is something that the government has to decide to fix now as we wind down we're getting closer to the end of the video so this is kind of for for us nerds uh the metrologists the matricians who really want to say okay well how do we measure this stuff and this is just kind of like me throwing wet spaghetti at the wall as I mentioned earlier existing key performance indicators kpi like labor force participation rate probably won't matter as much in the future we're going to need to measure economic productivity uh and individual well-being through entirely different means but this underscores the the key question which is what are we trying to optimize for GDP is a proxy for a lot of other things but it's also an aggregate number that is on its own relatively useless just kind of like how the stock market is an aggregate number that for you and me on a day-to-day basis pretty useless so one idea that I had was a well-being index which would be based on self-determination Theory um and so it would measure a population's well-being based on autonomy Mastery or competence and connection so that would be like how much free time does everyone have in the in in your um in your uh Nation how much Social Mobility do they have in terms of the ability to live where they want and go on the vacations that they want to and take on the leader activities that they want to so autonomy would be a really important thing to measure and try and optimize for Mastery or competence would be another thing and that's a much that's a lot harder to measure in aggregate because for some it looks different for everyone for some people Mastery might be getting a third PhD for other people it might be joining you know a football league or something it again it's really difficult to measure and then finally connection is the third component of self-determination Theory or sdt and connection it can easily be measured by number of friends that you have amount of time you spend with friends and family and that sort of thing um so uh another uh existing index is the Ginny coefficient which measures wealth distribution and wealth inequality but again that is just a proxy for other things and that presumes that wealth solves all other problems which it certainly helps it solves a lot of problems but it doesn't solve all problems another uh potentially valuable framework in order to create these new kpi that we might need to optimize for in post labor economics would be Maslow's hierarchy of needs is everyone getting their basic needs
