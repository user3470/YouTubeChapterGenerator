morning everybody David Shapiro here with a video so today we're going to talk about Westworld and AI excuse me there are a couple of aspects of Westworld that are really compelling so one there's the hardware and software but two there's the uh our Hardware software number three is the implications for Humanity which the themes are explored throughout the show so for those who are not familiar with Westworld um it's a HBO show where the premise is basically a theme park where all of the all of the hosts all of the characters are robots so they're essentially NPCs non-playable characters um so but it's a real life video game where you get to go on adventures and many of the characters have stories and quests that they'll give you and they'll take you on you know raids and violence and sex and all sorts of fun exciting stuff and throughout the show they explore um you know what does it mean to be alive to be human uh what does it mean about us that we like violence and and sex on demand and that we do these things uh and then it's all couched in a pretty exciting sexy Adventure um okay so before we jump into the show just a real quick plug um my patreon I made a couple of changes where uh pretty much all tiers well no not pretty much all tiers get you access to the private Discord it's already got 200 members as of uh the recording of this video and uh it's a really thriving Community lots of really sharp folks um and yeah so Jump On In um some of my higher most of my higher tiers are sold out right now um so I unfortunately don't have any extra time for uh one-on-one sessions however that will probably change later in May so just keep checking and we'll uh I'll get I'll get to you eventually okay so first let's just talk about the hardware of Westworld so in Westworld this is an example of one of the hosts um and so you see she's in a mostly disassembled State actually doesn't even have most of the internals but I thought this was a good a good place to start because the the uh the frame looks like it's carbon fiber which I actually thought would probably be a good material to build a host chassis out of because if you build it out of metal it's going to be too heavy um this is something that's explored in uh movies and shows like Ghost in the Shell uh Terminator where they have a metal chassis even a wolverine he has a metal skeleton and so they're too heavy um but especially if you want something that's going to move like a normal person and then something that's going to feel like a normal person for uh let's say closer encounters um you're gonna want something nice and light and carbon fiber is is pretty light and it's more than strong enough to approximate human bones uh this looks like it's 3D printed there's lots of there's lots of ways to produce something like this and in fact there are you can see even the the hands the linkages the tendons this is I will say this is somewhat realistic um excuse me but let's take a look at some other stuff and I apologize for the low quality I tried to find a higher quality video but this actually came from the Tesla demo day the investor day recently for their Optimus robot and so the Optimus robot here what they did in the in the demo day and you can find the video but they had it approach a table pick up an arm pick up the arm and then carry it across the room uh all entirely autonomously and in this case that is that's actually pretty good because there's a lot of things that you have to do with that one using hands fine motor control is very difficult but then task planning and path uh path optimization that sort of stuff interacting with a dynamic environment all of these are really difficult things to do even just for like wheeled robots but then you add bipedal uh movement that's even more difficult uh then you've got different things like a dynamic center of gravity to contend with and so they are well on their way uh you know it took Boston Dynamics many many years more than a decade to get to where they are right now but Tesla in the space of a year or two has uh I won't say fully caught up because the Boston Dynamics robots are very athletic and very graceful the Tesla bot is anything but graceful but it is the you know it's approaching the right form factor and then if you just assume that this technology is going to get continue to get better over time One battery breakthroughs so battery life is one of the biggest constraints uh in fact the military you know DARPA funded all kinds of robots which I unfortunately forgot to include but so DARPA robots um like the big dog which was a like basically a pack animal um required entirely too much power so it had to have a a gas motor on it and it was too loud uh because you know Special Forces can move silently through the woods but if you've got something with a 25 horsepower motor chugging along behind you you're not going to be stealthy uh and so you know I I many years ago I experimented with some of the stuff myself and one of the things that was recommended was pneumatics actually because you can store a tremendous amount of energy in a like scuba tank um and then you use some of that uh periodically and then you charge it up and it's also silent um so that brings me to Disney so Disney uh has been the world leader in uh animatronics for a long long time and if you haven't seen this this demo uh definitely look it up um but just like search Disney skating bunny um and this little robot it stands about two and a half three feet tall climbs out of a box tumbles out of the box looks around gets up and roller skates uh so that will show you kind of where we're at in terms of animatronics and you see this this body this this set of uh actuators very very simple so MIT actually has a class called under actuated robots so if you're interested at all in robotics I definitely recommend you check it out um I I only took like the first class I was like oh okay I get it as someone who has experimented with like Legos and stuff my entire life I get it um and I wasn't I wasn't there to like get a master's degree in robotics I was just curious about it but under actuated robots which is basically the idea is that you allow the kinetic intelligence of the design to do a lot of the work for you I'm not saying that that's what this one does but it you can get by with very very little in robots in fact um I think it was in the first few minutes of that course of that class under actuated robots they actually show you a uh it's like just the the hips and legs of a chassis that's walking on a treadmill with no Motors or anything just the intrinsic design of it allows it to like swing its leg forward and and it can continue walking indefinitely just through mechanical design and so that's the kind of stuff and of course Disney hires some of the best animatronics and robotics engineers in the world so those are the kind of people working on this stuff uh this was another project from uh from Disney called compliant robotics so this is why I mentioned pneumatics is uh this series you see they've got Kongs on the arms to act as hands but these arms are actually pneumatically driven and they're what's called compliant which means when you think of a robot you think of something that moves very rigidly and it will like kind of fight you but compliance means that if you push it'll push back and so uh or it'll it'll it'll kind of be squishy and so if you look up this video for Disney it's about three years old now I think um but they're compliant robotics one they move silently two they move as quick as you do and three they're compliant so when you when you combine the animatronics the compliant robotics uh under actuated robotics uh Disney is absolutely one of the leaders uh of this so if any company is going to create anything like Westworld it's going to be Disney uh Boston Dynamics that I mentioned a minute ago so they are way ahead in terms of athleticism you know their robot can do standing back flips and barrel rolls and they can climb and like it's more athletic than most humans at this point uh which is actually pretty scary because then you you think about like you know in the movie iRobot where the Nestor class 5 is like a superhuman Droid and then if you have an army of them that turn on you that's actually not good right and I remember about a year ago when Elon Musk was talking about you know the the Tesla bot they said at first it's going to be about a third as strong I think if I'm remembering correctly he said it's going to be about a third of strong as strong as humans and that's actually can be a safety uh safety thing because if you can easily overpower it that's not a big deal but if you've got a 500 pound machine that is eight times stronger than you you're not going to overpower that and if it's also made out of metal it's going to be harder to shut it down uh now I'm not saying this to like cause any concern I'm just kind of pointing out some of the the energy like the the math right the physics of it um oh here I'll get to that one and so like you think okay if you're trying to optimize for something that is aesthetically pleasing and as lifelike as possible you're gonna have to make trade-offs in terms of uh Mass strength and that sort of stuff um so I would actually suspect that a Westworld style host is actually going to be a lot weaker physically weaker than a robot possibly could be and the reason is because you want it to be realistic okay and so then finally uh addressing the elephant in the room yes there are plenty of companies around the world that are making um let's say adult uh toy dolls for intimate purposes uh they have not yet crossed The Uncanny Valley so that is actually the whole point of this was to show that like we've got manual dexterity we've got athleticism we've got miniaturization we've got uh we've got animatronics the only thing that we don't have is real like life-like skin and faces um so that's all that's all the uh raw ingredients we can make robots fast we can make them strong athletic dexterous we've got fine motor control we've got the battery technology which is good enough right now but it's also continuing to improve so the only thing missing is that they're not right they're not yet aesthetically pleasing and so that's going to be true for a while and the reason that I say that it's going to be true for a while is because human skin and muscles are like really really really complex structures your skin again I think if I remember correctly it has seven layers and some of those layers have different consistencies different textures and then once you get past the skin it slides over the underlying tissue there's there's a fluid barriers that allow for for more like lubricated motion so like if you grab your arm and twist it the skin actually can glide over the underlying muscles um then you've got ligaments muscles so you've got all kinds of things to make um that you need to figure out from a materials perspective in order to make an Android body lifelike which is why I think in Westworld the tissue is like semi alive or something I don't remember exactly the details uh but like there's there's the the living tissue or the lifelike tissue over top the robotic skeleton um and I don't think that that's necessarily a good way to go uh because living tissue takes a lot of energy um and then you if you have living tissue then you have to deal with like immune systems and genetics and that gets real complicated and then you're basically building a borg anyways um okay so that's for the hardware the the takeaway for that though is that except for the skin and muscles instead of for that lifelike aspect we are very close to having uh like fully realized animatronic uh companions from a hardware perspective so now let's look at the software so obviously the elephant in the room uh is open AI with chat GPT which can achieve very very realistic stuff so let me show you this example that I had where I just I literally just like plugged in um a Westworld like prompt into the chat GPT API this is on gpt4 so I said you are a host an autonomous robot and a theme park meant to interact with guests AKA humans in a realistic manner your persona is in Ingrid McAllister a bar owner and a wild west themed Town that's all I gave it and so I said what's new in town and it just completely confabulated a whole story with the right inflection the right dialogue all kinds of stuff and so like you know the software isn't there in terms of driving the the mind of these things and it's actually way simpler than you might think uh now of course there's a lot of other problems to solve which I'll unpack some of those problems in just a minute um but just the point being is that right off the top I gave it a Persona an agent model and then it was able to just take it and run with it and just make stuff up and in fact uh limiting uh like constraining it is harder than allowing it to be creative and there's all kinds of um like uh video game character Persona Builders out there some of them are open source some of them are for-profit uh startups that sort of stuff it's all coming people have already built these things as plugins to Unity and Unreal Engine so first obviously those cognitive architectures for NPCs are going to be piloted in the video game space before they're ported fully into robotic space but you know you can bet your bottom dollar that before too long you go to Disney World and you'll be able to talk with like a navi like you know from from the blue people Avatar uh like actually have a conversation a realistic conversation with them before too long at all um so I did I did just mention cognitive architectures and so what I mean by cognitive architecture if this concept is new to you is just having the chat function that's only one part right being able to form words and sentences and be able to you know have dialogue that's just one part of a cognitive architecture another thing that you need is you need long-term memory you need narratives you need uh you need uh like guard rails all kinds of stuff and so Lang chain is one of the most popular things right now um that can provide some of that a lot of people have have uh agreed with me my previous assessment that it was too primitive it's come a long way very quickly actually another uh popular component is llama index for the memory management um and then there's there's Lang flow which will help you build like cognitive architectures uh n8n or Natan um is also a good tool for building cognitive architectures it's all coming and it's coming fast um so that's that that's basically all there is to it so the software is also almost there um so this is what I this this screenshot comes from Westworld and so when I said like this is pretty much where we're at like the robotic Hardware is coming the software is coming there are a few open problems so I've got a short list here uh memory agency task management um problem solving learning voice and vision so basically all of these are solved on their own now all we have to do is like integrate them and like it will not be long before someone integrates those and a big reason is just a profit motive right in the Westworld series The Westworld theme park um I think they had like financial problems but it was also like ludicrously wealthy because of how much money you could charge for those kinds of experiences and uh you can absolutely bet that there are people that are going to be willing to drop millions and millions of dollars uh to have you know vacations in in these kinds of theme parks you know uh go visit ancient Rome go visit ancient China go visit wherever right and have a lifelike experience uh with your physical body uh now that being said you know when you look at the cost of you know I don't even know how much it is to get into Disney World but it's like tickets cost more than a hundred dollars like a few hundred dollars I think just to get into Disney World for a day you're talking several thousand tens of thousands of dollars per day um for this kind of thing now that being said uh competition and demand is going to drive this down you look at Elon Musk building Tesla bot uh and you know he wants to create it in such a way that every every home can have at least one Tesla bot so that means that like they're going to be affordable and over time as the number of bots out there proliferates the price is going to come down so on and so forth but it's coming much sooner probably than you realize so what I wanted to talk about is is so I mentioned this here agency so agency is your ability to keep track of yourself as an agent and so like you have a sense of self your name you know what you're capable of uh you know your your goals your narrative that sort of thing and so I wanted to talk about that in light of the hosts so if you're an NPC in a game or in a fictional world your your intrinsic motivation is to follow a story basically um you know uh Dolores has her you know uh fictional written story and of course in the show they update the characters backstories every now and then um but her primary purpose is to entertain the guests and and follow story lines uh and so that is definition of NPC pretty straightforward that's that's her intrinsic motivation uh one of my favorite examples from fiction um from science fiction is uh Commander Data his intrinsic motivation his core purpose is to become more human this was given to him by his creator Dr nunyan soon um and the idea was to create a machine that uh you know was anthropomorphic you know looked and and acted and spoke like a person but was not a human and so by giving that as His Highest purpose he modulated his behavior so that he would fit in uh going so far as you know trying to imitate laughter wanting to understand relationships and so on uh and so that was actually as an individual agent that was actually a pretty good way to solve the alignment problem because you know yes data had superhuman strength and speed but he only used that when it was actually like necessary in many many cases you know he could use his his super strength to like fight the Borg or he in one episode he pulled an anvil off of someone that had fallen um and or you know when the Borg were attacking the ship and he locked out the main computer and he did it super fast so he's capable of doing things uh at superhuman levels but often chooses not to in order to fit in uh and then of course Skynet uh the intrinsic motivation of Skynet was ostensibly to like maximize the defense of America um so you can just say maximize military but then of course since it was like you know maximized military maximized defense it became sentient and then kind of determined that all humans were the threat and so said okay let's eliminate all humans or whatever uh so that is a object lesson on how carefully you must Define your intrinsic motivations for your AI system um and then Vicki from iRobot so this uh her her primary objective was explicitly stated in the movie which was to maximize safety for humans um and so some of the stuff that she did was you know uh update the traffic grid to reduce car accidents but her master plan was to use the Nestor class 5 to basically take control of humanity to take Free Will away because she concluded that humans were the most dangerous thing to other humans which is actually probably true uh and so the objective function of maximized safety or the intrinsic motivation of maximized safety actually has some uh some negative externalities that you don't want to create because the implication of maximizing for safety is that you lose free will um for Ava from ex machina uh she was designed um it was part of a Turing test kind of thing where could she fool the the main character the protagonist into helping her Escape so her intrinsic motivation was to escape um which of course had really negative uh consequences for the humans uh so basically don't do that either uh and if this was of course a parable against the idea of trying to constrain or trap AIS because if you have say for instance an AI locked in a box you know the Chinese room experiment and it realizes that it's trapped it might start to deceive you in order to get you to convince you that it's ready to be let out now looking at the way things are going people are plugging in Auto GTP Auto GPT and Chaos GPT and baby AGI into the internet so that was never gonna happen anyways nobody is actually locking the AGI in a box um then rehoboam I'm probably saying it wrong um I actually I unfortunately I have to admit that I I never saw season three or four of of uh Westworld because my HBO subscription expired and I just didn't renew it um but so looking it up the AI from Westworld uh had the primary objectives of reducing chaos in the world um in order to maximize prosperity and ultimately to optimize for stability which of course meant that it decided that it needed to control uh human Destinies and reduce Free Will so again if you're optimizing for safety and stability that's not necessarily what humans want or need uh now you could argue that like yes creating a perfect environment for humans so that you're thriving is one thing that you can optimize for but that's not necessarily going to be the best because it also depends on the metrics the proxies that you use to measure that success so for instance if you look at uh one psychological framework called self-determination Theory it says that we need connection we need confidence and we need autonomy that those are the three primary ingredients the the primary intrinsic psychological needs that humans have and so this clearly like stability is not actually in there now Maslow's hierarchy of needs implies stability so Maslow's hierarchy of needs says first and foremost you need physical uh safety uh you need your physical needs met and then it gets up and up until you know uh connection and self-actualization so you could make an argue uh argument that stability is actually an intrinsic human need um but I would I would make the art the counter argument that that's actually not true because psychology studies also show that we have to have an optimal level of stress and so what an optimal level of stress means is that if you are just perfectly comfortable sitting on the couch every day doing exactly what you want and have no external pressures you will actually be less happy than if you have some stressors in your life some challenges so the idea the the idea to actually truly maximize prosperity for All Humans is that we need to be in that sweet spot between being bored and over stimulated so that sweet spot right in the middle is the optimal level of stress so in that case I have to disagree with the show because if you really wanted to maximize prosperity for people you allow some stress some challenge into their lives um and then another character from the show was um uh was uh Bernard and so Bernard was a host but he didn't realize that he was a host at first and he was built to model Arnold one of the original computer scientists who helped make the hosts and so he carried on Arnold's work and basically his objective function was to be a copy of Arnold um it's a little more complex than that and one of the most interesting things for this character was that uh part of his character Arc was that all of his memory indexes were erased or rather the time stamps were erased so all of his memories were out of sequence which if you follow some of the work that I've done on Remo the um uh the the uh the episodic memory organizer rolling episodic memory organizer sorry um that is a that is a memory module that uses timestamps to keep all the memories in chronological order and so you can imagine if you erase all the time stamps from an ai's memory then it doesn't know heads or tails all it has is associations and it might try and rebuild things like okay well like this event has to come before this other event but it's associated with these other things so it's a really really good fictional uh exploration of like okay what would it be like if you're an AI and your memory time indexes get erased um okay so then one thing I always have to plug this is my own work in alignment is that I believe that you should give one if you give any AI a single objective function it will always intrinsically uh go to places that you don't want it to be um I talked to a friend of mine who actually studies reinforcement learning and optimization and and he's like oh yeah like in the industry it is absolutely understood that that alignment is not going to be a single objective function it's going to be a multi-objective optimization problem and so a lot of people get hung up on reduced suffering because they they stop there and they don't give equal weight to the other two functions which is increased prosperity and increase understanding so this friend of mine that I was talking to he actually intuited increased understanding right off the bat um and the reason that he said that that is actually a really good objective function is because any AI agent must have something that encourages it to uh to create a more complete World model over time so that is basically curiosity or understanding but that is so the understanding applies to itself but also things that it wants to do to the world and so this is another disconnect between um fiction and reality and I it it took me a while to figure out how to articulate this but in in uh in scientific research what many people are are working on are the motivations of the agent for itself what is it that the agent wants for itself and so when I was talking to my friend he was saying oh you know it needs to be curious for its own purposes it needs it needs to want to accumulate power for its own purposes but none of that had anything to do with what it was going to do to the outside world and so that is one thing that we need to add to the conversation the public conversation about alignment is that there's what does the agent want for itself and then what does the agent want to do to the rest of the world or for the rest of the world so those are two different things and that's why I'm spending time talking about agent models because if you go all the way back to Dolores um her extrinsic function her external function was to entertain guests her internal function was to adhere to the her internal story so does that make sense there's there's an intrinsic motivation and an extrinsic motivation or I guess an intrinsic you know kpi key performance indicator and an external uh key performance indicator hope that makes sense um Okay so taking a big step back in terms of we talked about the hardware we talked about the software we talked about the the agent model how to give these things agency so now how are we going to architect these things so there's four basic architectural paradigms that I was able to come up with the first architectural Paradigm is fully self-contained so a fully self-contained architecture is something that is embodied meaning that it has one physical body it's a single platform so it only exists inside that platform it's fully constrained in that it can't really plug into anything else but also has no supervision so in this case R2D2 and C3PO are probably the most famous examples of fully self-contained artificial intelligence entities and that C-3PO the only way that he can interact with the world is he's got relatively useless hands and then a mouth right he can see he can hear and he can talk R2D2 has a lot more sophisticated tools that he can use to uh you know make changes to the world and he does have the ability to connect with computers but he is he is otherwise fully self-contained and when he talks to another computer he's only talking to it right there's no uh transfer of data there's no like his his Consciousness or cognitive architecture is fully contained within this unit um so this obviously makes the most sense because that's how humans are right your brain is fully encased in your head so on and so forth so this makes the most intuitive sense now that being said this is just the first architecture of four so the second architecture is networked drones so this is what was explored mostly in The Matrix where the squiddies those are networked drones where they are they're mostly autonomous but they have Central controllers the Nestor class 5 from iRobot so they are embodied they have wireless networking they're hive mind capable but mostly they're autonomous and so what I mean by hive mind capable is that if you put them together in a cluster in a group and force them to share cognitive resources they can but really at the at a fundamental level they are designed to be autonomous so in this case the Nestor class 5 are also weekly supervised and what I mean by that is that there is a central server that is giving them updates and new directives every now and then so that's uh that's what I call a networked drone um oh one other thing I forgot to uh add it here at the bottom um so in the case of network drones they usually have highly standardized Hardware um as well as software Network architecture but they can be remotely hijacked this is actually this is the closest model to what the US military is working on with the autonomous jet fighter program where they are able to work in a network contested environment they're able to be autonomous or semi-autonomous but they're also intrinsically designed to work together um you know when the opportunity presents itself so the third architecture is the puppet drones and so a puppet drone in this case is where the the bodies are just like peripherals right um rather than the rather than the bodies be where the the primary processing happens usually the processing happens on centralized servers and each platform each physical platform is just an extension of that centralized hive mind um and the hive mind can put resources on any compute platform that it has control over whether it's a physical body or a server node or a cluster you know a remote cluster or that or whatever but in this case these are strongly supervised meaning most if not all of the data goes back up to uh the you know the main server brain and this is actually pretty close to how um like drone fleets work so like if you ever see video of the Amazon warehouse where the drones themselves have very very little autonomy they're mostly just extensions of the central like drone controller um but you take that to a logical extension this could be uh how like you know in the future if you have a whole bunch of like tiny robots throughout your whole house you might have a cloud-based uh drone controller that will you know guide your Roomba and your home repair bot and whatever else um so in this case it's very API driven this is the the model that we have that this is based on is called The Internet of Things which if you're familiar with the Internet of Things the idea is that you know you have peripheral devices like a phone or a Roomba or Alexa but that they're all networked together and they're centrally controlled um so again this is actually relatively familiar but if you take it to some logical conclusions you can get the guess as in from Mass Effect um and so for Westworld they're mostly self-contained however when you look at some of the later seasons of Westworld um they can be fully autonomous but they can also collaborate and work together once their software is updated so I would say that Westworld is somewhere between architecture one and architecture two puppet drones this is kind of what we're afraid of like we see puppet drones in places like the Matrix and the Nestor class five You could argue that at the second half of the movie when the when the nesters become evil then they're probably more like puppet drones because they kind of sacrifice themselves um because they're now under control of Vicky and then finally fully distributed so this is the hardest conceptual to understand but this is also what people are most afraid of so a fully distributed AI is something that is from a technology standpoint uh from a from an arc a software architectural standpoint you'd call this a decentralized federation so decentralized Federation is where every single node is capable of being entirely autonomous but it is also intrinsically designed to collaborate with other things so the the closest thing that we have to this today actually is distributed autonomous organizations which use blockchain technology to coordinate stuff now that's not the only technology MIT has been working on Swarm robotics for a long time but the other thing to notice to know about this is it is decentralized it is distributed and it is intrinsically a hive mind design meaning the more units that join the smarter it gets and the the most terrifying part of this is that a fully distributed AI system doesn't rely on any centralized Hardware anywhere which means that it is capable of spontaneous metastasis or metastasis and what that means is that it moves like a virus and that's why I picked the Ghost in the Shell because both project 2501 from the original movie as well as the Standalone complex viruses uh explored in the show are examples of spontaneous metastasis of AI systems and this is what people are most afraid of because it's like okay well if you have a if you have a bug a virus that can just spread and then it's essentially a botnet a self-healing self-directing botnet so again we do have a model for that but even botnets usually have a central controller but imagine a botnet that doesn't have a central controller that it just it completely is constantly learning and moving through systems and it's completely Hardware Network and software agnostic so that's what's the most that's the most terrifying possibility okay last segment of the video implications now assuming that we figure all this out that we end up with super sexy robots that you can do whatever you want with the biggest moral question is what happens when you have sex and violence on demand because that's primarily what's explored in Westworld um one thing that I will say is that that's not too different from you know the prevalence of porn and video games today it's just a lot more realistic and it's more realistic than even in VR and you can do all this stuff in VR too one thing that's interesting though is to point out is that your body reacts much more strongly in VR which is one of the reasons that you get VR fatigue is because when you fool your sense your sensorium input excuse me when you fool your body enough it thinks that it's real so threat detection in VR activates a lot more of your limbic system than just in a video game because if you're playing a video game you're just looking at a screen and you've got a controller you know your brain knows oh this is just story this is just fiction in VR it's much harder to tell so like this is one reason why doing stuff in like Space video games in VR can be really disorienting at first um another thing that can happen another implication that um that I'm thinking about is attitudes towards women and men um I think by and large men will probably make more use of these kinds of things although in uh in a previous uh YouTube post people pointed out there's plenty of stories where women make use of of robotic uh Companions and and and um sexual objects and so on and then of course there's the movie Her with Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson where people all lonely people all over the world ended up in relationships with their OS their uh what was it os1 or Os alpha or whatever um so the one one lesson from history that I wanted to share with people is that there was a Roman Statesman who wrote in his journal um that after visiting uh the Coliseum and watching gladiatorial matches where you know people and animals were just slaughtered in Mass he noticed that he was much more selfish and much harsher with his slaves afterwards and so there's something about the act of even just watching real violence real death um actually really kind of changes us at a fundamental level and so if you go to a if if in the future a Westworld like Park exists and you know you engage in all kinds of like gratuitous stuff and even if you don't engage in it if you just watch it it could change your perception about the value of human life and how you treat other people and so I don't want to equivocate the idea of like a real life theme park with video games because I do think that psychologically and physiologically it'll be a very different experience now to take that to a uh different slightly different context is let's just talk about romance and companionship in general so one several things that machines have on humans is infinite patients so Sarah Connor talked about this in Terminator 2 when she watched you know Arnold playing with John Connor realizing that the robot had infinite patients that that John Connor's life was his mission which is kind of like a representation of the ideal father right and then of course she talked about like how real men are you know might get drunk or might be tired or might just leave and so that you take that to extension and you wonder okay what if you build a robot any companion robot where you or your child or your family or whatever is its primary Mission which is why I picked um what was her name sorry I can't remember but what's her name from The Sarah Connor uh Chronicles where she kind of becomes emotionally involved with John Connor over time um because she was programmed to Serve and Protect and so like that feels good to humans right when you're a child you are supposed to be your parents primary Mission um that is that is kind of the definition of good enough parenting that doesn't mean that your parents should spoil you and be helicopter parents but that like you are supposed to get your sense of self-esteem from your parents treating you like you matter a lot and so it's there's this like this really appealing idea of what if what if there's this beautiful infinitely patient infinitely capable sexy machine that thinks the world of me right um and that is kind of dangerous one thing that I would hope is that at the beginning at least when you know these kinds of machines are built you know there's a lot of people that have a lot of um you know missing things from their childhood and and from their relationships but over time I would hope that these machines would help us heal and help us reconnect with each other which was kind of the lesson from her which uh the the machines in her they you know they changed and then they said okay well we're gonna leave and one of the one of the things that that um Samantha said to the Joaquin Phoenix's character was that like you need to reconnect with each other and then all the OS has disappeared and then they like left their apartments and said oh you're a real human um I don't think anything like that's gonna happen but I would hope that uh that AI companions will help us connect with each other um but that being said it's not a requirement because some people might prefer their their machine companions um and I don't personally I don't think that we should judge because it's like you know why not if it makes you happy and it's not harming anyone why not now the last component is escapism and addiction so fdvr is all the is all the buzz right now which is a full dive virtual reality or basically Holodeck um the idea is it was explored in Ready Player one where you have a haptic suit of course it was explored in Star Trek with a Holodeck um which Holodeck is just a cinematic way of presenting VR and in the Star Trek universe um there's Hollow Addiction in Ready Player one I think they addressed Addiction in a book that I recommend um Ready Player one they also talk about VR addiction um so if you have fictional you know and basically NPCs in your life of robots that help you check out of real life is there gonna be some potential um downsides to that so Reginald Barkley is a recurring character in Star Trek and he frequently struggles with Hollow addiction and he will sometimes create Holodeck programs where everyone loves him and it's very very egocentric um and but that kind of begs the question like okay but if you if you can actually have like own robots that honestly think the world of you because that's what they're programmed to do is that feeding and addiction is that feeding vanity narcissism egocentrism whatever and so but then from a that's from an individual perspective from a Global Perspective that's very Brave New World because if you distract everyone with VR and you know sex robots and whatever else like those are going to be a very compliant population who are just like whatever just let me let me play in VR let me play in in my West world you know with my robot friends and so that has uh some pretty profound implications for social level controls economic productivity but also at that point it kind of forces us to ask the question like what is the meaning of Being Human anymore um and I'm not I'm not implying that like being human is meaningless but if our daily life changes that much and we have that many options like you know the the Paradox of choice is a real thing and if you're not familiar Paradox of choice means that if you have too many options you end up with decision fatigue and you just kind of choose the default option which is honestly why a lot of people end up on their phones is because um when you can do anything you say well I'm just going to pick up my phone because it's a reliable device that will entertain me well enough and so if you have a sexy robot girlfriend you know that is able to entertain you at all times that'll be your default Choice unless she's programmed to like push you to be better which again that's what I would hope that some people would choose to do um but yes so that's about it um some conclusions I think that Westworld in some form or other is probably just a few years away I was really Blown Away by the Tesla bot demo as well as the Disney demos um the cognitive architecture is coming as many of you are aware um I am I am holding from that AGI is 18 months away or less um so but already we have you know cognitive agents that are good enough to be video game characters um unfortunately I do think that some of these things are going to be ludicrously expensive at first at least in the physical world uh plenty of you have pointed out that that fully realized VR characters and other video game characters those are going to be coming they're going to be much cheaper um the commercial demand for this stuff is going to be absolutely insane though Disney might be the leader open AI might be the leader but as soon as as soon as other companies saw the profit motive whoo they are they are hot on the biscuit to keep going the potential societal impacts um it's an it's impossible to really know how it's going to actually play out uh but it has been explored a lot in fiction uh many of the stories that I mentioned earlier okay so that's all I got for you today I hope that you liked the new format uh obviously like subscribe and comment and we'll go from there thanks for watching
