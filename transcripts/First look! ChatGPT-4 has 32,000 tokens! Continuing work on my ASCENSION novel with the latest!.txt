hey everyone David Shapiro here um who I don't know when I'm gonna post this video but gpt4 just dropped and um so I'm already experimenting with it um now the biggest thing that I noticed in the live stream demo was that the chat gpt4 has a token count of 32 000 tokens and the ratio of tokens to words is roughly two-thirds so that's about 20 000 words twenty thousand words is a lot that is about a hundred Pages uh just shy of 100 pages of text um which is enough working memory to do basically any human task almost any human task especially when you consider the amount of intrinsic knowledge or background knowledge or latent knowledge that the model has so we just hit a new era of AI so the the only way you can use gpt4 right now is if you're on chat GPT plus um and I already signed up for the API of course but it looks like it'll be a minute so anyways so I'm going back to Ascension so here's the notes that I had for Ascension um and then I also have the previous uh uh one right here um so what I'm doing is I'm adding in some of the information that I was brainstorming last time Okay so let's see what are the specific Milestones there we go all right so let me add some of these notes and we're just gonna we're just gonna go refresh Ascension part two uh great here are some other notes we worked on in another session um here actually let me just grab this as a whole [Music] um because the uh the context window is so long great here are some notes from another session we worked on um wait there's more are you ready so one thing I've noticed already is that gpt4 is a little bit more hot on the biscuit ready to go so you got to tell it like wait um of course I am here to help take your time okay blah blah blah I don't want to interrupt it so you'll notice that gpt4 is a little bit slower so that's fine all right so then we'll come up here um let's see I just got uh this one um here are some possible milestones here actually let's just let's just grab all this great um actually no that's fine oops let me check if there's more so basically sorry for the silence I was just kind of thinking um so I'm giving it everything and this is let's just oops let's just copy paste everything into a new word document and see how many words this is so this is only 2300 words so this is about a tenth of the context window so we're we're already planning the entire story um basically copy pasting everything that I've already got let's see there it is okay there we go okay great so now that we've got this okay um I think that is the grand total of all the information we've got about story so far please um recap everything in totality um uh about this story please capture all details um in a complete report um I will be using this document to some uh uh let's see two uh what's the word um let's see as a as the main uh let's see there's a there's a term for it in in fiction um where you use it like it's your main Bible what's the main Bible for um story okay so while that's going let's talk about gbt4 um so I watched the whole live stream gpt4 is multimodal it can accept images um if you look at product um they mention I think they mentioned videos um did they no okay so basically it has it can understand images which means that it can look at a screen right it can look at your code it can look at what you're doing and understand what it's doing so it's multimodal on the input I don't think it's multimodal on the output that's fine um and you can see okay here it is it's going a little bit slower um there we go um yeah but you know so in terms of the cognitive performance of gpt4 it looks like it's an incremental um improvement over GPT 3.5 um so that is that is the that is like where we're starting um but on top of the incremental improvements there is uh there's this the cognitive Improvement and so if you look on this um it they talk about like how much it has improved on benchmarks so the uniform bar exam Chad gbt placed in the 10th percentile so it passed the bar gpt4 placed in the 90th percentile so that means that um gpt4 now outperforms 90 percent of lawyers on the bar exam and then the biology Olympiad it was in the 31st percentile now it is in the 99th percentile so uh to say that this is a Quantum Leap Forward is not an exaggeration so I just posted a um a uh uh a poll a couple days ago um I guess it was actually one day ago I I said will we achieve AGI this year and 20 19 say yes AGI this year 73 so almost three quarters of people say no AGI in the future and then um nine percent say AGI already happened I suspect this is going to change after people see what what gpt4 is capable of okay cool um disentangling from Power there we go Moment of Truth great um okay this is not quite as detailed as I had hoped but that's okay because all the information is here um let's see you seem to be missing Act One um plot Beats so let's see what it says okay so um I was just talking to my fiance about the scale of 32 of a 32 000 token memory so that's about 20 000 Words which when you combine that twenty thousand words with the intrinsic knowledge that the model already has so that means that you only need to give it the relevant updated details like the documentation that you're working on or um some episodic memory or whatever and it can kind of confabulate or triangulate the rest of the of the missing information so for instance I don't need to describe Rome to the model when I'm talking about Rome um so that is pretty interesting not only that it is it surpasses human abilities uh in a lot of things and so here I'm just giving it a little bit of steering and off it goes to the races and I'm like okay great um great um what do you think um should we try to write act one or uh plot the rest of act two and three so let's see what it says I'm as a language model I'm happy to help you with either option okay um so that's actually good I did say at the beginning that it seems like it's a little bit hot on the biscuit so I would have expected it to say let's rate um but it seems like it's taking a little bit more balanced uh uh proposal right now yeah um you know what we don't know exactly where the story is going to end up um so I would say Let's uh because 20 000 words that's going to basically be the first act so well let's see what it let's see what it says okay um I think we should go ahead and plan and write act one in a bit more detail uh most novels are 30 to 50 chapters um so act one should be um eight to uh what's that about 15. 8 to 15 chapters or so uh can you take those main plot Beats we discussed and map those onto about a dozen chapters or so please include details about what happens in each chapter um be sure to include information about plot advancement character development um world building um and uh and themes for each chapter so one thing that I have found in using chat GPT to help me write is you can weave together all four of those pillars of Storytelling in one go plot character setting theme those are the four primary ingredients you put those together you tell chat GPT that's what you want and I won't say nine times out of ten about fifty percent of the time it does pretty good A couple other times you have to say let's look at this from a slightly different perspective um and that's where I use jungian archetypes and Joseph Campbell so that it's so that it basically adopts like oh actually I know what I'm talking about when we talk about constructing a story you could also use Save the cat or any other um models uh for storytelling so you can say like let's do a five act structure like a Shakespeare or a or a four act TV structure so anyways let's see what it does with this so one of the one of the common rules is less is more um and so this is becoming increasingly true as these models become smarter you give it just enough information um to to know what your goal is and then you kind of set it free all right so introduction selling the heirloom there we go chapter three exploring Rome experiencing the city's vibrant atmosphere Rome's Landmark social classes daily life themes Discovery contrast between rich and poor chapter four a chance encounter I love these not these titles okay so because let's see I don't think I think the first Patron that's too soon because also she's like a teenager I don't know well I guess if she's 16 or whatever so yeah explores the city a public event meets an influential woman confronts her mother yeah that was act yeah hold on hold on stop stop stop stop stop hold on a second so in this case it clearly lost the plot um so because we we had five plot beats here so um let's see uh let's see please expand the five plot beats um listed below into 12 chapters um because right now it's confabulating stuff so we can see that this this task complexity is not quite up to Snuff it needs a little bit more help um yep there we go all right so let's try again here's a detailed breakdown of Act One expanding the five plot beats into 12 chapters okay so it was off to an okay start I probably should have saved that but when I saw that it was It was kind of rushing through the story and to be fair rushing through the story like that is pretty typical for amateur writers actually is it takes a lot of discipline to slow down and say we'll get there um there we go I like how we're kind of starting off nice and slow the sale of the heirloom Cornelia explores Rome the public event so public event is there a new mentor Court Intrigue and social climbing she's the first major Patron okay so it's really hell-bent on just jumping the gun okay so this this is an example of what I mean by hot on the biscuit um hang on you're getting to the um to the end game now uh let's uh let's say too fast um let's slow this down um think through everything that uh that happens in act one of a story based on the three Act structure or Joseph Campbell's um hero's journey now based on that let's brainstorm so telling it to brainstorm rather than just go ahead and write let's brainstorm um 12 chapters that only adhere to act one therefore act one must end with the Crossing the Rubicon moment of no return maybe we need to discuss that before proceeding okay let's see what it says you're right I may have progressed too quickly through act one again pretty typical amateur um uh uh move since I know better I can keep it on track I was hoping that it would be able to figure that out but that's fine okay for the Crossing the Rubicon moment this could be when Cornelia makes a decision that commits her to the path of becoming a courtesan there we go so the refusal will actually probably be refusing the mentor the mysterious influential woman okay so since it's since I gave it a little bit of feedback and guidance let's see if it's able to figure out that okay so she's exploring Rome the sale of the family heirloom okay there we go there we go so it's slowing it down so she discovers the heirloom in chapter two um then she explores Rome she's she's exploring she doesn't know what's going on then she sells it she decides to sell it because she realizes oh here we go um and then okay so the mysterious figure gets there uh better life and loyalty to the family oh here we go a chance encounter she meets her future Mentor who introduces her to the War uh um world of courtesans she attends a public event where she'll make important connections allies and enemies um among the events guests ooh so a lot happens at this event the mentors offer there we go the mentor offers her guidance and assistance in becoming a successful courtesan there we go the mentor provides her with resources and connections to get started family tension she faces disapproval and concern yes that is the debate perfect weighing the options Cornelia considers the consequences and the values she crosses the Rubicon she accepts her mentor's offer there we go much better excellent much better okay let's take that exact outline of 12 chapters and expand on um the details uh for each one let's start um uh let's start by so this is what I found chat GPT has the best is once you have the chapter then you say give me the scenes in the chapter and honestly this is not a bad way for humans to outline it too let's start by expanding um uh the list uh with scenes so each chapter should be between one and uh let's say three or four uh scenes I think most chapters in novels are one to three so that's fine um so given this please restate the chapters but expand upon them by listing listing out and describing scenes um yeah all right let's see if it can handle that do yeah so again you can tell that there is that I as an expert am providing a lot of structure and guidance to this so that's fine Cornelia and her family are shown struggling in their daily life showcasing this blah blah okay so it's just defaulting to two scenes that's fine um certainly uh for for more amateur writers just following something more algorithmic like this is perfectly fine I mean you hear me talking about you know the three-act structure and Joseph Campbell and and that so on and so forth so I can I there there was someone had it wrote a comment like was it my my my University literature Professor complained that they have spent the last 30 years trying to undo the damage that Joseph Campbell did and it's like you know what Joseph Campbell's work has produced many billion dollar movies so you know um if you watch the special features of Avengers end game actually there's a or maybe it was um Iron Man one of them anyways so in the special features of some of the MCU movies near the end of phase four um they had a round table with all of the directors and they kept alluding to the old book and I'm like hmm I wonder if that's the hero's journey because if you if you're familiar with the hero's journey and Joseph Campbell's work you watch um you know particularly um the Iron Man movies and the Avenger movies um they very very algorithmically follow um those kinds of things oh okay so there we go we're almost done we've got two scenes for each one that's fine she confides on a close friend or sibling so it's still it's still kind of waffling like it's it's being kind of generic but given how long this is and and the fact that it's it's staying on the plot um is is pretty impressive um I really like this okay cool um I'm gonna go ahead and copy this out actually because this is really good so we come back here so act one um so then we'll do uh let's see chapters uh let's see unformatted text there we go um let's see how long are we at we're only at 22 minutes we can keep going we can keep going um let's see where should we go next okay where should we go next um what do you think what typically goes into planning scenes all right so let's see let's see if it knows now that you have a detailed outline for act one you can consider moving on to planning Act 2 and act three however if you prefer to focus on act one for now you can delve in deeper into the planning of the scenes um let's see when planning scenes consider the following aspect's purpose ensure each scene has a clear purpose in advancing the plot developing characters or building the world um setting okay yep choose an appropriate setting characters okay so this is this is pretty generic but it's good in order to remind itself because there's um so there's this concept in Neuroscience called priming I'm actually reading this book behave um it is a very dense book but it's actually hilarious the dude who wrote it is sarcastic as hell um anyways so even just reading words of a particular tone can really drastically change your cognition and decisions and behavior the same is also true of language models just by priming it with some ideas like when I said think about Joseph Campbell and what goes into an act one and you saw how much it improved so this is called priming so a big part of using language models is priming um great cool so um I like that uh let's start with chapter one please write out a much more detailed outline of chapter one um after one the desperate decision scene one introducing Cornelia the story opens with Cornelia and her family's modest home providing a brief description of her parents and personality again this is all kind of uh algorithmic um if you open it this way like so if you if you describe the main character's personality or show it right off the bat that's going to be a little bit like kind of on the nose um whereas like you you definitely should demonstrate your main character in the first chapter but if you just describe it with an info dump that's not the best um let's see I moved on to Scene Three deciding to sell the heirloom yeah we didn't we didn't go that far I like that it invented the name okay well searching for something valuable to sell she discovers the family's heirloom okay but that doesn't happen until chapter two um so it looks like it looks like we need to prime it again here so we'll do we'll come back here and say uh out after outline of chapter one um as a reminder here is the grand totality of chapter one that we've discussed so far please stay Within the bounds of chapter one okay now please expand this brief outline into a more detailed outline so you might have noticed that sometimes what I'm doing is I'm rewriting the last one because what you want is if it gets something catastrophically wrong like this you want to remove it from the chat history because otherwise you end up with what's called prompt contamination remember how I just talked about priming priming works both ways it can be positive in that you can prime the model to think in the way that you want it to but if it has wrong information in the history that's going to continue polluting it and human like humans can get stuck in a rut like this too right remember like if you're ever having a discussion or you're in a meeting or whatever and you get the wrong idea in your head it can be really hard to get out of that rut so in that case it's actually kind of similar to humans one advantage that these models have is you can just flat out erase the wrong information from its memory okay so let's see if it does a little bit better this time also I'm uh uh I'm still contending with burnout myself and so I um I probably shouldn't be doing this right now but it's just too exciting okay I like this description of the modest home with her family highlighting contrast between their current circumstances and their once prosperous past there we go Cornell helps her mother with chores revealing her dutiful nature and her desire to contribute to the family oh that's good so this is showing instead of telling much much better so remember when it when the last time it was like oh we're just gonna tell you about her personality no wrong you show their personality and so you you show that she's helping her mother with chores you show that she's bickering with her siblings um you show them talking about how things used to be great um Cornelius father returns looking weary and defeated the family gathers for a simple Frugal meal highlighting their financial difficulties this is phenomenal um I'm gonna call this a day because holy crap um this is this is exciting and just to think that chat GPT just came out a few months ago that was what four months ago and we're already what quadrupling going from 8 000 tokens to 32 000 tokens uh this this poll that I did AGI this year yeah tell me what you think now all right that's it wrapping it up bye
