hello everybody David Shapiro here with a video today's video is about the topic of the so-called AI Winters and the Gartner hype cycle and my perhaps controversial opinion that the Gartner hype cycle really doesn't apply here so before we jump into the video as always just want to do a quick plug for my patreon I give all my code away for free I have all my videos ad free because the best way to help bring about a good future is to spread the right information with as little friction as possible but that means I am 100 dependent and funded by a Grassroots Movement by all of you on patreon so please consider supporting me on patreon and I will keep doing what I am doing so the concept of AI Winters uh has happened several times there are some videos out there you can find them pretty easily on YouTube where in the in the 60s uh there are they kind of expected that uh artificial intelligence was going to be solved really quickly there was a rather uh kind of hilarious thing where uh somewhere in New England um they they said oh yeah like we have this new idea we're just going to get a work a working group together and the five of us are going to figure out artificial intelligence over the course of the summer that was in like 1962 or something and of course uh hindsight being 2020 that was a very very silly uh kind of assertion to have then fast forward to the 80s and expert systems uh became uh all the rage and the idea of an expert system was that you could uh that if you have a subject matter expert you could just program in all of the logic and all the reasoning that a human expert and you could embed that into the machine somehow uh that that had some benefits but it was still very limited and it wasn't flexible and it was very tedious and they discovered all kinds of limitations and then finally uh you know the modern era is machine learning so it started with data mining which was all the rage in the early 2000s with basically you know database systems were growing and so then it's like well we have all this corporate data what do we do with it uh and of course uh there's been a few breakthroughs over the last 10 or so years uh and now the expectations are rising again and we don't know where the top is so this is the Gartner hype cycle if you're not familiar with the Gartner hype cycle the idea is that when uh when something has a breakout moment you it just keeps going up and up and up because people don't know where the top is and so then it's just the sky's the limit right but then reality sets in and it's like ah this is this actually isn't that good uh maybe maybe we were just completely wrong at the at the outset and then over time because it takes time to adapt to new technologies and learn how to use them and see how they interact with existing Technologies and often you will have multiple Technologies all at once the iPhone moment is a prime example of this kind of pattern where the iPhone didn't invent mobile data the iPhone didn't invent smartphones uh blackberries had been around for years but the iPhone was the correct combination of Technologies and design and then it's like oh we get it this is this is the next wave of mobile Computing and then finally the plateau of productivity where you know your your phone is basically as sophisticated as a tricorder from Star Trek almost uh and now it's nothing special but the productivity part is actually so this is one thing that's that I think is deceptive about this is that it's right in the middle but this is in terms of excitement level uh but this the the plateau of productivity is actually where 90 plus percent of the actual benefits are created so keep that in mind okay so my primary assertion is that you haven't seen anything yet and uh for for some background this is where it all started the universal sentence encoder paper back in 2018 which 2018 seems like forever ago now that's only five years ago uh but this is what started the entire Trend uh for me at least and so uh it was only a year later like almost exactly a year later that gpt2 came out and then almost exactly a year after that the gpt3 came out and the rest is history so this is a relatively new trend so keep in mind that this that the the underpinning technology is only like five years old maximum and then uh you know on the scientific front uh we've all been talking about the long net paper which uh creates a context window of one billion tokens which remember the context window of a billion tokens that's roughly half a lifetime worth of reading uh that it can read in one shot which is pretty incredible the implications of this technology are impossible for us to really predict and understand okay so I asked chat gbt I said how can you differentiate between hype and substance on the Gartner hype cycle and uh this is the list that it gave me one you need Market proof two you need to see the adoption rate three you need to see actual long-term value not just the excitement four you have to establish what's what uh stage of the development cycle you're in and then finally does it actually have any practical applications well on the market proof side chat GPT was the market proof that we were all waiting for I and others knew what gpt3 was capable of uh for for several years now but then the chat GPT ux was the breakout moment that that Suddenly It's on everyone's radar so the market proof is there let's talk about the rest of this investment follow the money money is a really good proxy and investment is a really good proxy for adoption the fact that uh that uh Global investment in AI is going up exponentially that tells you something because this is not just exponential growth in parameter count or papers this is exponential growth in people being actually willing to throw money at this problem uh up and to the right that's all you need to know GDP value this is projected future value so remember part of the part of discerning hype from substances what is the actual value and these charts keep getting revised there's a New York Times article that said you know AI is going to add 4.4 trillion in value to the global GDP this one says it's going to be 16 trillion that number just keeps going up and to the right so the idea that we are going to have uh just a tremendous amount of economic uh Boost from artificial intelligence is just incredible uh and it's again these numbers keep getting revised up so there's the value there's the expect the expectation of value mergers and Acquisitions so you know mergers and Acquisitions uh is another proxy for adoption because if you actually not only are you investing in AI from a you know corporate standpoint but if there are startups that are worth buying that means that they are passing muster and they are producing valuable products valuable services and so we saw it taper off during the pandemic understandably uh and I couldn't I actually couldn't find a graph that shows the last couple years not sure how it's shaped up but you know you understand that like okay this this exponential ramp up of AI um Acquisitions also pretty strongly into indicative of what's actually happening out there so what this leads you to uh to question is are we in another bubble uh certainly we saw a Tesla run up to be worth more than like the rest of the car industry altogether which is pretty typical if if you look at Tesla as a tech company that behavior kind of makes sense but then people realized actually it's not a tech company it's just a car company and now the rest of the car companies are uh catching up with and in many cases surpassing Tesla uh particularly in production numbers um as well as adding new uh capabilities uh working slowly towards full self-driving and Robo taxis uh we saw nvidia's stock price triple over the last six months uh which again pretty typical of tech companies and so what you should expect to see in the stock market is you're going to see what's called a market pullback and so basically this is when the initial expectations cool off and you have what's called a price correction which is that people realize that a stock is overpriced and so then it corrects down uh and this is due to a uh fancy term called irrational exuberance uh irrational exuberance is what drove up the price of Tesla it's what drove up the price of Nvidia uh because people are saying oh man I need to get in on this and I'm just going to keep buying and that and the supply and demand drives up the price so one thing to keep in mind though is that the stock market is not the economy and the and that the stock market is also not a representation of productivity one thing that I want to point out is that even though the.com bubble popped in 2000 when did the Fang companies the the Facebook and apple and uh and Netflix and Google when did all those come to be they came to market dominance more than 10 years later and so that's what I that's why I wanted to urge caution because the uh the plateau of productivity it's not it's after the excitement wears off it's after the bubble bursts but it's actually where most of the productivity uh truly happens and so also I need to to caution you none of this is financial advice this is just some of my personal opinions and observations from investing over the last 20 so 20 years some so so odd years um okay so what will the peak of inflated expectations look like in one word utopianism in two words salvation fantasy yes AI is going to solve a lot of problems it's already solving problems we're already using AI to map out new drugs to discover new vaccines it's accelerating uh the research of quantum Computing it's accelerating the research of nuclear fusion uh it's it's doing all kinds of stuff and then of course there's the you know hundreds of thousands of tools and implementations that just generative AI is is doing this image was an example of that where we are generating images we're starting to generate videos so we're still exploring this blue ocean possibility but the idea is we don't know where the top is and so the idea is well what's the best possible outcome and that is the peak of inflated expectations and so as this idea of you know techno optimism of a Salvation fantasy that maybe technology will be the Panacea for everything all social ills and everyone's life is going to be infinitely better again yes it will solve a lot of problems and a lot of suffering will be alleviated by it but you need to urge caution because it's not going to solve all problems and in fact all new technologies usually create new problems so that leads to the trough of disillusionment uh so what is the trough of disillusionment going to look like we've already told ourselves all the stories about this with cyberpunk and dystopian uh novels and video games and movies so some of the objective things that might happen and again I don't need to rehash everything because we've got plenty of these stories in fiction these cautionary tales that we saw coming uh I I suspect that we will see some Supreme Court decisions in the United States that erode privacy freedom of speech and Denim and undermine Democratic institutions I certainly hope we don't have that but given the Supreme Court that we have today uh I would not be surprised at all another thing to pay attention to is stuff like corporate personhood if AI starts running corporations and corporate and corporations have some degree of personhood uh well you know then that is it that is literally a direct path for AI to have legal personhood now I did some research into this and corporate personhood is not the exact same as like a human personhood but basically the idea is that you can for legal intents and purposes in some domains in some topics you can treat a corporation uh legally similarly as as a human which is going to be problematic and I I hope that what we do is that artificial intelligence proves that we actually need to pull back on corporate personhood uh because you know well yeah you can imagine but then the manipulation and exploitation uh you know what we saw with social media and botnets and troll farms and that sort of thing uh that's going to be termed up to 11. it's already being done uh here in America where uh as the presidential race uh gets uh just is just getting kicked off we're already seeing uh synthetic images being used for manipulation and that's only going to get worse and then in the in the most cynical The Darkest Timeline it's deliberately used by uh corporations uh you know if you look at the AI art generators that can create the sexiest pictures of all time imagine that instead of getting targeted ads you're getting targeted like thirst trials uh to advertise to get your attention to get clicks um so you know I think that I think that we're going to see some Trends towards uh more cyberpunk implementations of artificial intelligence but then also from the global scale Global fragmentation geopolitical competition and military use uh you know the deployment of Slaughter Bots against civilians um the the current trends of de-globalization and multi-polar chess and so what I mean by that is basically the world is gearing up for World War III as far as I can tell uh battle lines are being drawn uh people are peop by people I mean nations are pulling their cards and playing closer to the vest uh and then of course there's the possibility of synthetic biology and gain a function research aided by artificial intelligence that could do things like create targeted bio weapons this was this was the subject of uh of the last uh Daniel Craig James Bond movie uh no time to die where they created a synthetic bio weapon that could basically just Target um an ethnic group or even a family or an individual that sort of thing is hypothetically possible and so the trough of disillusionment the primary thing that's going to drive this is the realization the broad realization that all Technologies are dual use or in other words it's a double-edged sword whenever you create a powerful new technology you can use it for good or you can use it for bad but technology is by itself intrinsically neutral The Darkest Hour of AI uh in this trough of disillusionment is going to be the darkest hour of humanity and it's one that we might not survive which is why I do the work that I do now if we survive that then the slope of Enlightenment will be a long march towards Redemption and it will not be clean it will not be fun and it will not be perfect it's not going to be sunshine and rainbows we will need to use to fight we'll we'll need to learn to Fight Fire with Fire And basically instead of using AI to erode democracy we're going to need to figure out how to use AI to protect democracy and human rights we are going to need to synthesize a new culture and so what I mean by that is as a as a civilization we will have to adapt to this new paradigm so a good example is think about 200 years ago 300 years ago when 90 plus percent of people were all Farmers that was one civilizational Paradigm with the rise of the first and second industrial revolutions which brought in steam power and then eventually internal combustion engines and mass production that changed the paradigms and so we went from primarily a rural AG agricultural civilization to an urban and Suburban civilization over time so that's what I mean by synthesizing a new AI literate culture we are going to change again and that change is going to be disruptive there will be social harms and there will be upheaval it's not going to be comfortable and it's not going to be pleasant even if we do our best to start trying to navigate it now and of course we still have plenty of people saying oh it's never going to happen so you know the the longer we have denialism the longer it is the more delay there is to start adapting to these things which again this is why I do the work that I do we're going and and the the hardest part of the slope of Enlightenment where it come where it pertains to AI is building multi-polar piece the 20th century mentality was there can be only one uh you know Nazi Germany said that they thought they honestly thought they were going to conquer the world um at the beginning of the 20th century the British Empire was the preeminent Force they slowly lost control Nazi Germany came up then uh then the the cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union the idea was there can be only one power and now with Russia on the decline China on the ascendancy plenty of other places on the ascendancy Africa and India namely we are come we're slowly coming to realize that we are going to have to form a multi-cla multicultural Global identity and that this this mentality of that there's only going to be one is actually not really a healthy thing to have because if you believe that your culture must Dominate and conquer the rest of the planet well guess what if someone else has that same belief that imperialistic belief then you're inevitably going to fight and so what we have to realize is that the world is not going to be 100 Western liberal democracies or 100 Eastern uh Central authoritarian regimes and machine intelligence a machine-based civilization is going to be a forcing function and so what I mean by that is that the the the the the black mirror that artificial intelligence holds up to society up to humanity is going to force us to ask very difficult and uncomfortable questions about ourselves and about humanity and it's going to push us over the edge and now when you get pushed over the edge do you just plummet into the abyss or do you learn to fly that is the nature of the slope of Enlightenment and that's why I said it's not going to be clean it's not going to be pretty and it is it is going to be a long slog the plateau of productivity is only going to occur once we establish a new normal after the singularity and I know that some people think that the singularity means that it is intrinsically unpredictable uh I think that that is a bad definition of Singularity uh really the only the only mathematical definition of singularity in terms of technological process is just the compounding returns of things like artificial intelligence and Quantum Computing and the amount of information the amount of knowledge that we have increasing exponentially that doesn't mean that the fundamental laws of the universe are going to suddenly be shattered it just means that the rate of progress of information and knowledge is going to continue to accelerate which we were already seeing the beginnings of right now so what does that plateau look like is it going to be Utopia is it going to be dystopia is it going to be something else well a couple things that I've talked about one is post labor economics um AI is Paradigm shattering in the same way that the the first and second industrial revolutions were Paradigm shattering so does that mean that we're going to have Ubi post scarcity hyperabundance who knows but the the thing that you can count on is that our lifestyles will be drastically different our lifestyle uh in 10 to 20 years is going to be as fundamentally different as lifestyles are from 200 years ago instead of waking up at five every five in the morning every morning to you know feed the cows and feed the chickens and and you know get the plow horses ready I wake up at 5am to make YouTube videos and it is what it is uh now another thing to think about is transhumanism and post-humanism with the rise of genetic engineering and cybernetics and synthetic biology and whatever else happens uh maybe some people do merge with machines I don't know but the key thing here is that the definition of human might start to drift and that is going to be part of that plateau of productivity where like I said 90 of the of the value of the gain happens after all this initial disruption so where are we we are here we are not even halfway up the peak of inflated expectations we still have to get uh we still have to jump the chasm where only a few of us are the early adopters but the tidal wave of artificial intelligence that's coming is going to be an irrepressible and unignorable force before too long and so keep in mind this this Gartner hype cycle the utopianism of the of the peak of inflated expectations the cyberpunk and backslide towards dystopian uh outcomes for the truff of disillusionment and then the slope of Enlightenment that's going to require synthesis and emergence of something entirely new we will have to synthesize an entirely new paradigm of humanity of civilization of our culture and only then once we once we pass that gate once we pass that threshold will we get to the plateau of productivity where 90 of the benefit of AI will be realized and that's going to be around near or after the singularity thank you for watching I hope you got a lot out of this cheers
