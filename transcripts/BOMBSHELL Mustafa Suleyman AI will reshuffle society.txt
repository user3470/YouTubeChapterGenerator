just a few days ago on September 1st Mustafa sulaman the co-founder of Google Deep Mind and current CEO of inflection AI dropped an absolute bombshell on the internet and then walked away like a mic drop and nobody seemed to notice so I'm here to fix that so here's what happened he wrote an article in Time Magazine online and the title of the article is how the AI Revolution Will reshape the world uh the tldr is that AI is about to reshape and reshuffle all power structures in the world now let me read just a couple of the quotes from you uh from this article for you um you can check it out yourself it's really short it's 6,000 characters long so like a thousand words uh but anyway so this these two quotes stood really stood out to me it's not just automated call centers this wave will fundamentally reshape and reorder society and it is those with the most to lose reliant on established Capital expertise peace Authority and security architectures who are precisely the most exposed and then later on in the article he goes on to say I've seen this kind of willful blindness before I call it pessimism aversion a tendency to look away from sweeping technological change and what it really means until recently it was a common Affliction of the Silicon Valley Elite many of whom pursued technological disruption without considering the likely outcomes so a couple other key points from this article which again it's on hi magazine it's Mustafa Suliman I'm not sure why people are not losing their minds over this uh Power redistribution so he's talking extensively about how this technology will disrupt the existing power structures and redistribute it he's talking about how AI is unique in terms of technological advancements it's not just another iPhone moment there's a few reasons that it's that it's different and that primarily led by the democratization of Technology it's getting more powerful it's getting cheaper and it's getting faster not only that is it it's advancing faster than any other technology we have seen uh and then he goes on to talk about you know uh the power reshuffling um basically you know the unprepared professional classes which is a big reason for the work that I do when I talk about post labor economics we need to start preparing for an era where middle class white collar jobs are the first to go and then he called he you know he talked about pessimism aversion which is basically uh this is something that a lot of uh people criticize rightly so Silicon Valley for looking at the world through rosecolor glasses and then finally talking about need for Preparation which again is why I'm here okay so check out the article if you want pause it like I said it's really short or just take my word for it but I it like I said it's very straightforward so here's the analysis let's break it down um new ownership models this is one of the key things that keeps emerging and of course there's a lot of people that are talking about cryptocurrencies and dows and that sort of stuff so blockchain technology could be an ingredient in new ownership models but as I've talked about how AI will likely destroy jobs and disrupt markets one thing that we're going to see is that and I'm not saying like oh we should you know you know get comrade marks up and you know seese the means of production I just use this graphic because I think it's hilarious uh to use the anime filter um anyways here's how here's how new ownership models are going to actually emerge first shrinking Market margins because Tech is going to drive down prices as uh margins get narrower a lot of uh companies and sectors and industries they're just not going to be viable anymore and what I mean by that is they're not going to be profitable from an extraction capitalist model instead they're going to be so cheap that you might as well just have them as Municipal services so there's been a few people that have messaged me that are talking about rather than focusing on universal basic income one of the things that we'll see is universal basic services so I've talked about hospitals in several videos where I expect that the margins of hospitals are going to become so narrow that they're basically not going to be feasible as for-profit entities and so they're just going to have to be provided by the government the same way that the government just provides roads uh so basic Universal basic Services shrinking margins another thing is that um as some of these goods and services become too cheap to be viable uh business models it just makes sense for them to transition to Collective ownership either run and managed by you know Municipal governments or uh by collectives of private individuals uh whatever happens but the underpinning thing is that Automation and the decentralization of AI is going to be one of the primary drivers uh and and basically necessitate this and it's not like we're not I'm not saying put the cart before the horse I'm not saying hey you know burn it all down and start over I'm just saying a lot of a lot of goods and services will need need to transition to new ownership models as they become unviable uh democratization of information basically AI is the realization of what the internet promised and so for those of for those of us that are in our mid to late 30s we remember when uh in the 90s the rise of the internet everyone said it's the information Super Highway and of course no one has said information Super Highway in like 20 years but the idea was that uh instant access to all information on the planet was going to completely change the world and of course it did change the world but having hypothetical access to information and being able to practically use it are entirely different things it's kind of like when the Human Genome Project was done and it's like hey we've mapped the entire genome now what well we can't make heads or tails of it so it doesn't really matter so it wasn't until we had more modern artificial intelligence to look at genomic data to make sense of it so in other words the what artificial intelligence really does in terms of access to information is it makes it much more accessible and it allows you to make sense of it and this basically is a superpower for everyone okay so the preparation part uh Mustafa and I both agree we need to prepare and we are not yet prepared so here's some of the things that that he talks about and that I talk about this is our overlap so the number one thing is accountability and transparency we need to make sure that we start using AI in government and accountability and transparency as soon as possible so some ideas I have for this is leg legislative review um I have quite a few videos that I did last year uh at using you know chat GPT and and other API calls to slice and dice and read new legislation and bills and proposals that are coming out uh this is a really good use of these tools because nobody's going to take the time to read a 600 page you know piece of legislation every single week as this stuff comes out but AI is more than happy to read it for you and it can read it in about 30 seconds uh this is going to be a really good super superpower that allows us to stop uh fraud and Corruption of people slipping stuff into into uh you know legislative bills voter advocacy so this is something that a lot of people have started talking about in various sectors which is what if you have an autonomous AI agent that Advocates on your behalf around the clock on all issues that you care about so this idea was uh it it existed before open ai's uh project on um the uh Democratic inputs to AI but Democratic inputs using either autonomous or semi-autonomous AI that just makes sense it can help solve the coordination problem and ensure that everyone gets their needs met uh basically the rest the rest of these points are just kind of delving a little bit deeper and rehashing some of these ideas so I'm not going to uh bore you with uh reading everything to you the second thing is decoupling production so this is what I mean when I talk about uh post- labor economics what's going to happen whether we like it or not um I'm just saying that because of because it is inevitable we should advocate for it and make it happen deliberately is labor reduction we use Ai and automation to get people out of jobs altogether what are we going to do we're going to spend more time with friends family we're going to spend more time with Civic engagement we're going to spend more time with our Hobbies so on and so forth now the biggest problem with this and this is what Mustafa is alluding to is that that this will absolutely destroy White Collar jobs most White Collar jobs uh and it is possible that some jobs will come back or that some new jobs will be created but as I've mentioned in my recent videos AI is proving to be better faster cheaper and safer than humans in a lot of capacities and that's only going to get better with time and so the primary the primary way that this disrupts the power structure in society and not necessarily for the better is that the power of Labor declines our ability as laborers and consumers declines so what does this mean I actually saw some people posting my videos on on Reddit and they're saying okay well if all this happens how are we the people going to even have money to buy goods and services provided by companies that hold all the cards the biggest thing here is that we need to negotiate a new social contract so the current social contract says that the government mediates the relationship between business and labor that is the way that things work because businesses rely on human labor and the power dynamic between those three entities basically said say the government says hey I'm going to play referee uh and make sure that you know the businesses get what they want and need and then the people get what they want and need we've been under neoliberalism for about 40 years now which means that we've strongly favored businesses the pendulum needs to swing in the other direction why because labor is about to go out the door and so instead of business laborers and government the new social contract is going to be between business Labor uh businesses government and citizens sorry I probably said that wrong I think you get what I mean so by by reshuffling and restructuring the power dynamics of our society instead of around business labor and government now it needs to be business citizens in government it needs to include everyone okay so thanks for watching I hope this uh got your got your juices flowing and you're ready to be engaged vote like you mean it because well that's what it's all going to come down to is we the people taking power back and choosing politicians that understand this and advocate vifly on our behalf thanks for watching have a good day
