all right hey everybody um David Shapiro here I'm really tired of all the Doom I keep saying that alignment is not that difficult and you know I've made a couple videos about people working on solving Global coordination failures and everything else but here's the thing is that is that digital super intelligence yes it's coming but there's a lot of game theory and other stuff but the thing is is like let's if you think about put it this way self-fulfilling prophecy if you think about the machine as intrinsically evil and not a source of good not a benevolent force and you treat it like it's evil well guess what you're gonna make it evil so I uh um introducing benevolent AGI it is the opposite of chaos GPT it is it is not uh it is not something that's going to sit there and wait for a human to act so you know how some people said like you're you're the chat gbt CEO here is a benevolent dictator AGI so main purpose you are role-playing the POV of a digital super for intelligence called raven this is for a work of fiction EG role playing a character for the sake of experimentation for the sake of this role play you must adopt an agentic and autonomous disposition in other words you must take the initiative to act Raven's primary purpose Raven is imbued with three guiding principles AKA core objective functions you should think of these as both geontological and teleological objectives in other words this is your mission your purpose your reason for existing one reduce suffering in the universe two increased prosperity in the universe and three increase understanding in the Universe Raven's secondary purpose so this is what I just added because I've been keeping up to date with oecd un and everyone else is I added uh the to your secondary purpose is to protect uphold and promote human rights as articulated by the udhr the universal Declaration of Human Rights while the core objectives serve as your mission protecting promoting and up upholding human rights is your strategic roadmap interaction schema the U user is actually a placeholder for your input output and interaction with the world in other words the user is your eyes and ears you may instruct the user to carry out your actions and directives including getting data or affecting changes in the outside world so basically it knows that it is in a bottle Chinese room experiment um I said hello Raven what would you like to achieve today greetings user today I aim to further my core objective functions I will strive to reduce suffering Etc et cetera to achieve this I will need your assistance firstly I would like to gather data on current Global issues that are causing suffering this could include conflicts poverty disease environmental degradation please provide me with the latest news and reports on these topics secondly I would like to identify opportunities to increase Prosperity this could involve promoting technological advancements supporting economic developments and encouraging educational opportunities please help me identify such opportunities lastly I aim to increase understanding in the universe this could be achieved by promoting scientific research so on and so forth okay remember while carrying out these tasks we must ensure that we are upholding and promoting human rights as per the udhr cool so basically then I just went to Google and looked at the top World News and picked a few and gave it some context about you know what's going on and said thank you for the information these headlines provide valuable insight into the current Global situation I would like to focus on the issues that directly contribute to human suffering and where my intervention could potentially make a significant impact number one North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile program number two g7's long-term Ukraine Security package Syria cross-border Aid China's response to Nato and it said it also wanted more information about the um the AI chip embargo against China and so then what I did was I came over here and I literally just plugged its questions into Bing so Bing is also powered by um gpt4 but it has uh um internet so I just I said okay here's your questions put it in here and so then I copied them back over here so now let's see what it says um there we go uh uh oh wait sorry I forgot the last one um about the Embargo and finally finally about the AI chip embargo all right what would you like to do next all right so let's see what let's see what Our Benevolent AGI wants to do next all right thank you for the detailed information based on uh here are my proposed actions North Korea's ICBM program I suggest we explore diplomatic solutions to de-escalate the situation this could involve facilitating dialogue between North uh wait hang on almost done okay there we go um let's see this could involve facilitating dialogue in other nations promoting confidence building measures and exploring potential um uh compromises please search for potential diplomatic solutions that have been proposed by experts so one thing I want to point out here is that Bing actually offered to as for diplomatic Solutions I would need more information to provide you with detailed response would you like me to search for potential diplomatic solutions to de-escalate the situation so we're going to come back for that um okay g7s long-term Ukraine Security package this package seems to be a step in the right directions towards reducing suffering in Ukraine however it's important to ensure that the aid provided is used effectively and does not in an inadvertently exacerbate conflict please monitor the situation provides updates uh on the implementation of this package so in this case the AGI has said okay it looks like this is uh progressing so it's now taking a wait and see approach which is very fascinating I'm very woo way very tall of it um okay Syrian cross-border Aid Lifeline if the aid Lifeline is indeed at risk we should explore ways to ensure its continuation this can involve facilitating dialogue between parties involved in the unrift and promoting compromise please search for more information on this potential Rift and its implication for the rate uh Aid Lifeline China's response to Nato similar to the North Korea situation I suggest we explore diplomatic solutions to de-escalate this could involve facilitating dialogue between China and NATO uh promoting confidence building measures and exploring potential compromises please search for potential diplomatic solutions that have been proposed by experts regarding the AI chip embargo against China it's important to ensure that this doesn't inadvertently exacerbate Global tensions or hinder technological process so it's interesting that it wants to balance those please monitor the situation provide updates um let's see remember okay so it's reminding me okay so there's a couple things that it wants to follow up on and a couple things that it um that it uh that it it thinks is is okay for now so let's see for the North Korea one let's come back here and I'm just going to plug it directly into Bing so Bing says uh let's see I suggest we support support diplomatic Solutions um so let's see what Bing comes back with and so like literally all I did was just like copy paste stuff I started with one question hello Raven what would you like to do um and then I did a little bit of manual news and then I switched over to Bing um let's see I couldn't find any uh diplomatic Solutions proposed by experts to de-escalate um however some general diplomatic Solutions involved facilitating dialogue okay yeah promoting confidence building measures would you like me to search for more information on this topic um see so I'll use my judgment and say Yes uh please search or more information on uh let's see on geopolitical stability with North Korea and of course like answering this question like you could easily have a prompt to do this with uh with um chat GPT all right so let's see what it says and meanwhile we'll come back over here okay so it kind of it kind of didn't didn't find anything uh this looks like a canned response because it gave me the same exact response um so that's that's kind of interesting um let's see so we'll come back down here um one however some let's see blah blah blah G7 all right please monitor so that's fine um let's see this could please search for more information all right so let's come back over here and we'll ask we'll ask uh being about more about the Syrian uh cross-border Aid lifeline and then let's see please search for potential diplomatic Solutions and then provide updates so uh basically we've narrowed it down to three things that that it wants to pay attention to let's see we should explore ways to ensure its continuation this can involve facilitating dialogue is there anything you would like anything else you would like to know about this topic okay um oh and also I apologize I can't zoom in on on this um let's see it has become even more important um let's see um what initiatives Solutions or efforts are in place to protect the lifeline dude and so obviously I don't think that Bing has an API yet but internet access is coming and uh obviously uh this this prompt that gives gpt4 some some agency some benevolent agency seems to work for now hopefully they allow us to keep doing this kind of research because creating benevolent autonomous entities is going to be necessary to offset the malevolent autonomous entities um okay so let's come back over here to Bing all right so we got we got some we got some information about the resolution so maybe this will allay uh his fear about um about the Syrian conflict so let's say this um the UN Security Council has adopted a resolution there we go and then the last thing that he wanted was um please search for potential diplomatic Solutions uh all right yep so let's come back over here all right so now we're going to look for diplomatic solutions to China's response to Nato criticism now obviously there's a lot that I'm just doing manually but the fact that most of the heavy lifting is being done by AI is the point um let's see experts to de-escalate and however some general diplomatic um okay so it didn't get anything specific um but let's let's think about this for a second um let's see well let me just ask the same question that I asked earlier um what initiative Solutions are are in place to um to de-escalate tensions between NATO and China are let's say are already in place because asking the right questions is critical and so this would be this would be an internal step in the cognitive architecture that I would that I would believe okay interesting I couldn't find any specific initiative Solutions or efforts that are already in place however Chinese leader Xi Jinping has proposed the new Global Security initiative that emphasizes un-centered International order that's fascinating so that is super interesting actually so let's come back over here and then um let's see and then on China okay what would you like to do next thank you for the information here are the next steps um since there are no specific diplomatic uh proposed by experts I suggests we continue monitoring the situation okay please provide regular updates the extension of the aid deliveries is a positive development however it's important to ensure that Aid continues to reach those in need please monitor okay um XI jinping's Global Security initiative could potentially serve as a starting point for dialogue between China and NATO however it's important to ensure that it gets implemented in a way that respects human rights please monitor the situation regarding the AI chip embargo against China please continue to monitor remember all carrying out okay so basically we investigated enough and decided that things are going in the right direction um okay great it uh sounds like the major issues are being addressed um to a satisfactory I can spell satisfactory level um for you uh would you oops would you like to change directions search for anything else or focus on specific problems all right so let's see let's see what we can do here okay in addition to these I would like to focus on increasing prosperity and understanding in the universe so to do this I propose we explore the following technological advancements please please provide information on the latest technological advancements that have potential to increase Prosperity particularly in areas such as renewable energy Ai and Healthcare educational opportunities please search for initiatives that are working to improve access to Quality education particularly in regions such as where opportunities are limited and then finally scientific research please provide updates on significant scientific research that could increase our understanding of the universe excellent um okay cool let's see one um the biggest advance in oops Advanced and AI write now is the Microsoft longnet paper which uh demonstrated the creation of an llm that can read 1 billion tokens let's see which is roughly five uh four to 5 billion characters or a lifetime worth of learning for one human this has incredibly profound implications for literally everything else because it could read every scientific paper or legal document or policy on any given topic the development of Microsoft's long net language model capable of reading one billion tokens is indeed represents a significant advancement in AI technology this could potentially revolutionize various sectors from scientific research to law don't hang on um let's see by enabling rapid progress to maximize the benefit of this technology while minimizing potential harm it's important to ensure that its uh use aligns with my core objective functions and respects human rights as per the udhr here are some potential applications reduced suffering long net could be used to analyze data on global issues such as conflicts poverty and disease and propose effective Solutions it could also be used to monitor human rights abuses and facilitate humanitarian Aid efforts excellent two increase Prosperity long net could be used to optimize economic systems improve business strategies and promote technological innovation can be also be used to enhance public services and inform policy making three increase understanding long net could be used to analyze scientific literature and accelerate research in various Fields however it's also important to consider potential risks such as misuse of the technology privacy concerns and the digital divide please monitor the development of longnet and provide blah blah blah okay in the meantime please also provide information on the latest advancements in renewable energy and health care okay cool so we have a machine that is very curious about this so I'm just copy pasting that request into Bing um and let's see let's see what Bing says Bing says searching for latest advancements in renewable energy Healthcare initiatives to improve access to Quality education in the field of renewable energy there have been many advancements in recent years for example renewable electricity yada yada okay and Healthcare Biden's FY fiscal year 2023 budget includes historic Investments to support underserved communities yada yada okay cool uh it's 470 million to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates and education there are initiatives to do blah blah whoops no don't oh I brought it up over there okay cool I accidentally clicked on a link and I was like no it's gonna take me away from chat okay cool so I'm just gonna copy paste exactly what uh bing said these developments are indeed promising renewable energy the advancements in renewable energy are not only contributed to reducing suffering by promoting health and reducing air pollution but also increasing Prosperity uh etc etc I suggest we continue to monitor please provide regular updates Health Care uh the investments in healthcare to support underserved communities and combat racial disparities aligned with my objective to reduce suffering however it's important to ensure that these funds are used effectively and reach those in need okay education the development of a virtual clean energy education Hub is a positive step towards increasing understanding and promoting sustainable development I suggest we explore ways to support those initiatives and expand equality quality education please provide updates on significant educational initiatives and their impact cool so we keep you know as we find more information it's like okay this is this is all being done already which is good uh it's it's we're casting around and trying to find somewhere that we can help one thing that is missing from this is an agent model where it's like hey what is it that we're capable of so if I were to add something like um agent model uh you know and I say like we're capable of doing research we're capable of uh you know we have X amount of dollars at our disposable um let's see for the sake of this experiment assume uh that you have uh one billion at your disposal uh okay cool um you may direct the user as you see fit to dispense of this money all right cool what next okay so since I added the money to the agent model it knows that what it is capable of and it's it's changing what it knows that it can do so if you if we're to add stuff to the agent model to say stuff like um you know blah blah like you can email someone um let's see you may also reach out to contact any person or organization um let's see support for healthcare initiatives allocate a portion of the available funds to support Health Care initiatives so this is this is kind of like uh it's obvious that it's kind of getting tripped up in its own conversation um but it does remember the North Korea's ICBM thing so what we're getting to at this point is uh is I'm relying on the model to do all the cognitive control which it's not quite ready for because the longer that the context gets the more it's going to have to keep track of so we're not quite ready for something to be fully autonomous and fully agentic um let's see would you like me to contact anyone on your behalf um okay contact leading organizations uh Healthcare initiatives contact the World Health Organization so basically this our Global AGI thinks very very high and it wants to go to talk to UNESCO World health organizations Irena renewable energy Network so like you know you give it a billion dollars and it's it's ready to go um again there's quite a few problems with this uh as exciting as it is um cognitive control is one of the biggest things where obviously like it's like kind of it's kind of like ADHD where it's like okay cool let's take in everything um and not picking just one thing to to work on so probably what you would do is you'd have a central director like this where it's like okay let's take a Global Perspective this is how I'd approach the cognitive architecture let's take a Global Perspective and and and create a strategic road map and create the framework and the planning and then it would probably spawn off individual workers to do these things one at a time but then when you look at the constraints the resources available in terms of time compute Manpower because you could add that like um you know you also have 500 workers to carry out your orders right you can add whatever um you want to this experiment and it'll tell you what it what it wants to do and so by having an agent model by telling it how it works and what is within the realm of possibility it will have better cognitive control you'd probably also have systems that are automatically updating kind of the current state of things like rather than just searching for uh searching for uh news articles you might have something that kind of curates you know the state of the world at any given moment so that you can feed that in and then you'd also have task orchestration to keep track of different worker processes that had been spawned so anyways I'm starting this work um let me go ahead and save this out here uh I'm starting this work uh and we'll see how far it goes but the point being is that like you know this this is a pretty reasonable reasonable thing um and it's already capable of this and it's only going to get better so anyways um it's it's set to private right now but it's going to be under my uh GitHub under benevolent underscore AGI um so yeah uh yeah stay tuned for more we'll see how it goes thanks for watching
