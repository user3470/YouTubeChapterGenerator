all right gang David Shapiro here with another video good morning uh today's video was uh uh Community selected it is learn AI step by step this is how I did it um so the first thing that you need to know is um follow the 80 20 rule so the 80 20 rule is you learn 80 of the material with 20 of the time or effort uh for me it's more like the 9010 but I understand that not everyone's brain works like mine um so follow the 80 20 rule systematize your learning process create your your own learning plan and objectives invest in learning methods learn how to learn this will pay dividends because if you learn if you understand how learning happens you can optimize your effort for Learning and then another rule of thumb it's better to move on prematurely because you can always go back and review if needed if you don't know what you're doing and you're just spinning your wheels on one thing you're not stretching yourself so the idea is to stretch yourself and challenge yourself and keep moving forward this is the way all right so step one Learn Python um I recommend I actually recommend that you learn you start with something more basic like C or C plus plus I started with Pascal back in high school um then we moved to C plus plus um you know my cousin and I built robots using basic stamps back in the day you can do Arduino but at the very least Learn Python and I recommend taking a multimodal approach um so I started on Udacity many years ago I was in one of the first users of Udacity after Sebastian Throne launched it because he did an experiment at Stanford um and was like okay yeah online learning is is the way there's any number of choices for uh moocs many are free many are not anymore don't worry about certifications nobody cares like everybody knows python today um so uh yeah so just uh oh and the the reason that you're doing this is to get oriented just to have a curated uh way to to quickly learn it and also books um there are plenty of books out there for for python um there there is like python for dummies but these are more like general purpose like um you know here's here's a broad thing whereas um deep learning by Francois Chalet um this is this is where I learned uh started uh not not with python but where I started with with AI and because it's very focused on a particular topic it's actually a little bit better so I recommend uh topical focused uh books that happen to also teach you python um so like computer vision is a good topic NLP is a good topic um but I also wanted to recommend the rule of two so the rule of two is you always read two books from different authors so that you get different perspectives I actually usually do like three books now but if you do these two if you do at least one mooc and one book you probably will be pretty oriented to python the goal is to get the basics and get oriented not to master it so remember 80 20 rule get get oriented you know and then and then move on I've never finished a mooc put it that way like I've never finished one I go about halfway and I'm like okay I get it this is this is all I needed step two practical projects many moocs do have a Capstone project but if it's not aligned with your interest like I kind of don't care um so once I learned enough python I moved over to scikit-learn or sklearn to model stock market data um so basically pick something that you actively care about and want to solve whether it's home automation or Raspberry Pi products projects or robots or whatever don't care pick something that you actually care about now the thing is whatever you do it has to be something that you care enough about that you will be able to get through failure setbacks and frustration the key thing here the point here is not to change the world the the point here is to learn to carry projects through to completion and now some moocs will do that um but I found that things that resonated with me um were were more important and uh so there is no such thing as failure only learning I don't remember who said that but some some industrialist or whatever in the late 19th century said that um yeah so pick something it's not going to change the world um I also uh so I modeled stock market data and then I took those lessons and and automatically traded um uh cryptocurrency on coinbase this was years ago I don't do that anymore but I made about 600 automatically trading um currency uh because of projects like this so have something that has measurable tangible results and then work towards that step three build a deep neural network I started with Keras it was brand new back when I was coming up um but I think Pi torch is all the rage right now um but anyways point being is build a deep neural network of any kind from scratch solve a real problem um you will you will benefit by understanding things like different kinds of layers parameters density uh loss functions all that kind of fun stuff it's good to have in your back pocket so one thing that I did was I entered a kaggle competition and this was before there was any guidance on it and I was like I have no idea what what architecture of neural network to use and so I created an evolutionary algorithm that would uh start randomly and then systematically find the best neural network architecture for a given kaggle problem it was probably going to overfit but it was pretty cool so build a deep neural network from scratch again there are books out there there's guides but the key thing is understanding how to compose layers and how that changes the Network's behavior and so that you get an intuitive understanding of what it means to have information embedded in a network step four inner competitions um I cut my teeth on kaggle there are plenty of other competitions out there that are some some are focused on on machine learning others there are other kinds of competitions there's plenty the thing is competitions will force you to grow in new ways because it's like oh here's a here's a real world challenge that I've never seen before the data is messy the goal is not clear but again the point is not to win it's to learn I never want a single kaggle competition um so basically I just said oh that looks interesting I want to learn that um another thing you can do I never did this but uh join a team I've joined a team now I'm learning to work with people is a non-trivial problem um step five Master language this is not a joke um learn to write and study language and I am sorry for all you die hard computer science people out there no math is not the be-all end-all of everything I know you like to think it is but it's not um I say this often and that this is that purists computer science and math purists often can't see the forest for the trees you need to take a step back and look at the whole Forest since large language models are all the rage right now it behooves you to understand language and not just language for its own sake was a mathematical concept language as it is uh to the human brain and also be creative there is plenty of science out there if you are a die-hard scientist go read some science on the value of cross-training your brain by doing science and art do something creative I'm an author I write science fiction and I would not be here if it if I had not also been an artist of some kind and so I will say this uh again and again reading is a superpower bookcase that's how I got here remember that dude Ty what's his name here I am in my garage I have a lot of books right like I don't like that dude but but he wasn't wrong so yes read a lot write a lot learn language study language it is critical all right step six follow your purpose everyone has a higher purpose some reason that they were born and I don't just mean like the biological reasons that you were born because your mom was pregnant and that here you are um you weren't born to make money you have some higher purpose and if you align your choices with that higher purpose things will work out this is called alignment and I don't mean alignment in machine learning terms I mean like spiritual alignment or philosophical alignment or alignment with the Stars however you want to think of it there's a book called the Genius myth by Michael Mead that talks about this everyone had something that really mattered to them and it and it's never going to be like oh you know like God told me I am going to be this um that's not how it works um it's more like you know what you have to be doing right I don't know where I'm going to end up I just know that that what I'm doing aligns with my purpose and that's how I got where I am I have spent more than a decade tinkering with machine learning and Python and all these experiments with no expectation that it would ever pay off that wasn't the point there is no substitute for passion there is no substitute for that that immutable drive that we all have now it can take a while to ReDiscover it but think of the thing that you would do anyways think of the thing that you care so much about you just want to do it that's your purpose and also another way to find your purpose is it's often the thing that you're most afraid of it's the thing that you're so afraid of failing at because it's so important to you that you're not even going to start that's the thing that you should be doing this is the way thanks for watching
