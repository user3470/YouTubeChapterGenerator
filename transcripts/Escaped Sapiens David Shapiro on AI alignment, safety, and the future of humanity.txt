is there anything that makes humans Irreplaceable so are we getting into a stage where there's nothing that AI that humans can do that AI won't be able to do uh from a functional standpoint from a a an objective standpoint I don't think so um and that actually begs a very deep philosophical and spiritual question which is what is the point of living what is the point of being a human um and that uh is something that I've done some work on I've wrote a paper or a short book called post nihilism where what I suspect is that we are barreling towards uh what I call a nihilistic crisis or actually we're in the middle of a nihilistic crisis and it actually started with the Industrial Revolution if you look at a lot of poetry and literature works of fiction during the the rise of the Industrial Revolution a lot of people had a lot of existential anxiety about what was the point of Being Human in an era of machines and this kind of pops up every now and then right same thing happened with computers um with the Advent of you know uh high-speed computers nuclear weapons so on and so forth technological advances advancements tend to give us some existentialing but to your question about like okay what is the benefit of being a human in a world where from a product productivity standpoint or an economic standpoint machines can do everything that we can do better faster and cheaper what's the point and so that is where we have to change our orientation towards how we value our own life and our own subjective experience so that's a deeply deeply philosophical and religious perspective or a question and it's it's really interesting because depending on someone's spiritual upbringing or spiritual disposition the question lands very differently because many uh religious doctrines around the world basically say that humans have a soul and that sets us apart and so whether or not that's true uh people have a model for just saying my subjective experience of being is Matt is very meaningful and it is unique and so part of overcoming a nihilistic crisis is we all have to face that whether or not not we believe in souls or God or whatever and we have to kind of go back to basics and look at the subjective experience of our own being and so back to your question earlier about children I suspect that children who grow up with AI they will just intrinsically know oh yeah my experience is different from this machine and that's okay and that they won't have any existential anxiety about it I hope at least do you have are you hopeful for the future or do you have this anxiety um no I I am uh I think I'm biologically programmed to be optimistic I just I can't be cynical um and I I part of that is that I've done a tremendous amount of work to understand what the dangers and risks are and I've also tried to contribute to coming up with a more optimistic outcome the machines so we we all learned this from watching Scooby-Doo um the monsters are always humans right there's no such thing as as an evil monster out there the problem is always humans and so this is this is a big reason that I've done my work is because you know it's not it's not that a machine is going to replace you and that's a bad thing right we all fantasize about like hey I want to you know go live in the countryside and just go fishing every day we all know what we want to do if we don't have to work what we are truly afraid of is not being able to take care of ourselves is that if the machine takes our job we're gonna go hungry we're gonna lose our home we're gonna end up lonely and and whatever that's the actual fear um nobody actually wants to keep working right nobody want like I remember one of the advertisements for um for a like health insurance here in America was you get to keep your health insurance you like your health nobody likes health insurance it's a necessary evil right jobs occupations are a necessary evil of the economic environment that we're in and the technological limitations that we're in and so as these things progress this is this is I'm basically just unpacking why I'm optimistic as these things progress I hope that we're all going to be able to have kind of a Back to Basics moment where it's like you wake up one day and it's like how do you actually want to live right if you want to go fishing every day do it if you want to focus on being an opera singer go do that you know there's we all have stuff that we want to do but that we sacrifice for the sake of earning enough money to take care of ourselves and that is the reality for most of us today one of the reasons why we have this worry is because currently we live in sort of a negotiated environment right the successive labor movements was because labor was needed when humans are no longer needed there's sort of a worry that we're not going to have the opportunity to go fishing right where they're going to have nothing and I guess that's that's the the worry that you're pointing at what what do you think the first jobs are that are going to go well there's already been quite a few layoffs um various uh communities on Reddit or private communities on Discord um so for instance my uh fiance's uh were both writers but she's on a few uh private writing communities um copywriters have already been laid off and replaced by AI um uh marketing teams have been notified that you know they've got a year until they're all going to get laid off and replaced by you know AI generated images and AI generated emails um so it's happening um yeah that's that that's where we're at now I guess to to your your larger point of you know if we're all replaceable you know what's what's the bottom line and the fact of the matter is from a corporate perspective from uh from the perspective of neoliberalism human labor is one of the most expensive aspects of productivity and it's also the biggest constraint you look at a population decline in places like China and Japan because China just crested right so from here on out China's population is going down for at least the next Century Japan has been in Decline for a couple decades now uh ditto for Italy and a few other nations so their labor force is Contracting right and from an economic perspective that's really bad for for for Nations so AI hopefully will actually Shore up those Labor uh labor markets and actually replace lost human labor now because humans are so expensive right you can pay uh 20 a month for chat gbt and it can basically serve as an executive assistant and personal coach and every it can replace literally thousands of dollars worth of Labor and it costs 20 a month chat GPT is infinitely cheaper than most human employees um and that's only going to get better right because either the model is going to get more efficient and cheaper um or it's going to get smarter and more powerful and therefore more valuable or both in all likelihood so one one of the things that I predict is that we are going to have a post Labor uh market economy before too long and in that respect uh basically economic productivity will be decoupled from Human labor um and in that case you know you're going to see quadrillion dollar valuation uh for companies that have no employees and that might sound like that that could be an ingredient for a dystopian world that nobody wants to live in we'll get to like the regulation and stuff of that later but from a from a from a purely GDP perspective AI is going to be the best thing that ever happened to GDP to uh to uh economics because again it will decouple uh human labor from the constraint and that there there will still be a few constraints natural resources Rare Minerals uh fresh water arable land right there's going to be there's always going to be some physical constraints but we're going to remove human labor as one of the main uh constraints to economics and that is going to mandate kind of those things like you said like if you want to go fishing well how right if you don't have any economic power if you don't have any way to make a demand then that's a big problem which is what we're going to have to negotiate we're going to have to negotiate a new social contract basically what do you think the impact is going to be on births ultimately do you think people are going to just start having AI children because it's cheaper you know that's a really difficult question I could see it going either way um there's plenty of books and and and fiction out there and research papers um people have predicted you know the population uh explosion you know the Earth will become uninhabitable because we'll have billions and billions of people that we can't feed other people are worried that you know the population is going to collapse um and I actually had a pretty long conversation about this just to kind of clarify my own ideas uh again with chat GPT um and so there's a few driving factors that cause uh birth rates to decline um uh women entering the workforce education and empowerment for women access to birth control so it turns out when a society advances and becomes a little bit more uh sophisticated or or gains more access or some you know Ginny coefficient goes up whatever metrics you use education goes up fertility rates go down some of that has to do with the choices of Family Planning you know men and women decide to have fewer children women have more control over their own fate um and so fertility rates tend to go down and this is a very very reliable Trend globally um you know regardless of culture regardless of other economic conditions as education rates go up as uh uh women in the workforce goes up fertility rates goes down this is a global thing with no exceptions right so if you extrapolate that out then you can probably make a relatively safe assumption that as AI spreads around the world and economics and education and everything goes up that fertility rates will continue to go down around the whole world South Korea I believe has the lowest fertility rate on the planet at 0.8 births per woman which is uh like um just uh just above a third of the replacement rate so it's entirely possible that under these trends that a population collapse is actually the most real danger that we face so well what do you do about that one thing that I think is going to happen is that AI will lead to Medical breakthroughs and I suspect that we are close if not already at uh the the place of what's called Longevity escape velocity which is that the medical breakthroughs that happen every year extend your life by more than a year so basically hypothetically if you're healthy enough today if you're not about to die and you have access to decent enough uh health care then that the compounding returns of medical research and AI means that you and I could live to be several centuries old which means that the population of the planet will stabilize as birth rates continue to decline now whether I I do think that some people will ultimately choose like AI companions as they become more realistic certainly a lot of people have seen shows like Westworld um you know one of my favorite characters of all time is data from Star Trek and I would love to have data as a friend right um so I absolutely suspect that um that anthropomorphic machines will be part of our Lives before too long um whether what form they take you know whether it's a robotic dog that never dies or you know a walking talking friend that is always there to hang out or if it's a romantic partner like uh you know in the movie Her um with Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson there's lots of possibilities uh for how life is going to be but like I said I think one of the most reliable durable Trends is fertility rates go down so the question is will that be offset by longevity so in other words rather than sort of the the dangerous Skynet that some people Envision we might just get out competed sexually uh into Extinction something along those lines yeah that's that's entirely possible especially when you consider that um actually there was a line from Terminator two it was when Sarah Connor was watching uh you know the Terminator Arnold Schwarzenegger play with John and she realized that the machine has infinite patience and will always be there because John was his mission and I realized that from a philosophical standpoint one reading of that is that the machine could be a better parent than a human parent could ever be because for a child from a child's perspective they should be their Prime their parents primary Mission but that's never the case right parents are humans too and they have their own needs their own desires their own plans but when you have a machine that it's if it is designed that you are its primary Mission whether you're an adult or a child like that could be like from some perspectives a better outcome obviously some people are probably cringing which is understandable that's a perfectly healthy reaction to the idea of replacing children and parents with machines but it's possible Right hypothetically possible [Music] foreign
