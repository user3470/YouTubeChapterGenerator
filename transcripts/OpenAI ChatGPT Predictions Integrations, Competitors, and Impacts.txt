hey gang how's it going today uh David Shapiro here with another video uh today we are going to talk about chat GPT and uh predictions so what I mean by predictions is integration uh competitors and impact so for this year and Beyond um before we get started I just wanted to remind everyone that um if I get my financial goals met on patreon I can disable ads I think that ads are a waste of time um so if you want to do that there's also a link several links in the video description for the Discord community that I started there um my LinkedIn profile Twitter and also my home page where you can sign up for my mailing list so with all that said uh let's get started all right so open AI created chat GPT and you have you may or may not have heard um but a recent study or survey rather showed that 30 percent of professionals have already tried chat GPT at work that is incredible it has been around for a couple months so this is probably the fastest adoption curve we have ever seen for any new technology uh full stop so that is important to keep in mind so let's start with Integrations and so what do I mean by Integrations what companies are going to use it what products apis data sources that sort of thing so integration number one is Microsoft Office uh I had a video a week or two ago talking about how Microsoft they wanted entry they want to integrate chat GPT with Bing and then not long after that they came out with Microsoft Office um so they're going to integrate it with like Outlook and Microsoft Word that sort of things um so like what do you use it for why why integrate this with office well the thing is is that Microsoft Office is pretty Universal all lawyers use Microsoft Office all authors use Microsoft Office all scientists use Microsoft Office right everyone uses Microsoft Word for drafting any manuscript or monograph and so by integrating a tool directly with these you get it in front of millions of people so PowerPoint Excel word teams Microsoft teams is a big thing um so by it would it would make sense like there's no reason not to right um and they can figure out the use cases over time but the fact that you can have an intelligent conversation with something um you know I have videos where I show like using chat GPT to brainstorm um like writing right and then you have to switch back and forth between chat GPT and Microsoft Word so what if you just put those together and you have a little chat window on the side and then you can keep writing your work of fiction or your work of science or whatever and then it can you know ask you questions as you go and in fact uh you know many of you know I have a startup and the the arrival of chat GPT completely derailed one of the lines of products that I was working on um so it is what it is I would rather live in a world where there's more AI than less AI so I don't really care um you know and uh it's interesting it also moved the needle because now it's like oh people understand chat GPT so when I pitch something it's not it doesn't seem as far-fetched it's like I've been saying this for a couple years and people often look at me like I have two heads but now it's been proven uh so I'm not as crazy as uh maybe well I am crazy but I'm not as crazy in that way so anyways how's it going to play out so uh I suspect that they're gonna have a tiered pricing structure where you know you can have the basic Microsoft Office that is about what like 270 a year or something it's around 300 a year um so you have that and then there's probably going to be add-on packages that give you uh different levels of like chat GPT like you know you can have the the the high-end package that I predict will probably cost around a thousand dollars a year maybe more where you have unlimited access you have the higher speed because openai announced that they're going to have like GPT profession or chat GPT pro version or whatever um so they're going to prioritize for higher speed probably longer memory um stuff like that managing multiple conversations um there will probably be rumor has it and I say rumor this came from open AI themselves where they've been working with professionals subject matter experts for a while so I suspect that they are going to try and have like you know domain specific versions of chat GPT I haven't seen much evidence that open AI really comprehends any domains other than uh deep neural networks they're a relatively new company and they're not that experienced as a tech company or as a vendor more on that later so I suspect they're going to find more success by just creating a general purpose chat GPT with Integrations all right integration number two web browsers so a lot of people have already created uh chat GPT extensions for Chrome and Firefox and stuff so this this is already here but I suspect you're going to see higher end Integrations you know by open AI buy Microsoft so you'll have like the official subscription-based one and then it'll basically be just like a sidebar conversation like the little chat window for all web pages so you can go to any web page and say you know what's going on on this webpage or you know it can it can read the web page and say hey it looks like you're making a YouTube video you want me to write the description for you do you want me to write the title here's an idea and so basically you're moving away from search based right where you've got you know your little search bar at the top to chat based uh interaction with the web which could be really big right and that because not only can it be your concierge to the internet um it can help you with anything that you're writing and so I think it could probably replace grammarly if I was grammarly I would be scared out of my mind right now um chat GPT is going to single-handedly destroy several uh business models rumor has it that Jasper is in big trouble so they're going to have to Pivot away and not compete directly with chat GPT um I suspect Graham really is going to go the way the dinosaur and a number of other things but yeah so integrating chat GPT with web and web browser specifically this is going to change the way that we interact with the internet so this is huge and it's coming um integration number three mobile so there's been some I don't know if it's a I don't know if it's a leak or if it's just public information but um you know open AI is already has an iPhone uh chat gbt app and beta closed beta I think so imagine that like you have that same level of interaction where you have either a text based or a voice based way of interacting not just with your phone because right now it's it's still a brain in a jar right so you can have a conversation with just your just the app but smartphones have lots and lots of apis and Integrations and it would not be difficult to give that app more Integrations so you can have chat GPT connected to your calendar your phone your apps your text messages and so you can just say something like hey write a text to Sally that's you know blah blah does this or write an email to work that says this or find you know you know take me to the nearest uh best Mediterranean place um this is basically what Siri was supposed to be but of course the the language model was not sophisticated enough um and so because of this we're already seeing chat GPT even though it's only a couple months old it's already pivoting to be a commodity or a utility level tool where people are just going to expect it so we're going to see all every competitor right Google will probably have their own uh built-in version um very soon you know they've got home and other models that they're working on so I would not be surprised if Android has a native you know chat client before too long and again these are all Universal platforms right that's the that's the commonality between Microsoft Office web browsers and mobile is everyone has these and everyone uses them um and so it would it only makes good business sense for openai and Microsoft to put chat GPT everywhere that they can and let the rest of the world figure out how to use it right and this goes for competitors as well which we'll get to um integration number four this one is a little less obvious um I picked the uh the Le cars system which is the uh uh the computer system from Star Trek so basically if you're if you if you uh are a fan of Star Trek you always see Picard saying like you know computer run a system-wide diagnostic on blah blah blah and plot a course to Proxima Centauri and blah blah so I honestly this was this was the point of um of my Raven project was I wanted to have a ubiquitous uh smart assistant that could do anything and this is basically like Jarvis right from Iron Man you know uh the earlier Iron Man's before Jarvis became Vision um but it's like you know you could have an intelligent thing that is not just connected to the internet and your and your smart home systems but also uh integrated into more sensors and other things uh that gives you a lot of home automation and a lot of and Beyond home automation Home Intelligence because here's the thing and this is where it gets really sci-fi imagine that you're having like an argument with your spouse or your kids and you say like computer or whatever the name of the of the thing is like you know can you help us figure out like how to get along can you teach us what we're doing wrong how do I raise my kids right how do I get through this argument with my spouse like how do we how do we like you can have the this personal thing that's around you all the time and is intelligent enough to give you ideas and it's always listening too but this also presents a huge security risk right because here's something that humans do automatically that machines don't do which is one speaker wrecking recognition and we also maintain social context and so there's various masks that we put on based on who we're with right your your brain automatically keeps track of who knows what in your life and so there's certain conversations that are not appropriate to have say around children or around strangers and their certain facts that should be kept private and so there's a lot of work to do chat GPT version one cannot do any of this it is built to have interactions with one person right which is why a a a smartphone which is you know your device or your web browser that makes sense but as soon as you have conversations that involve um more than you know the the user and the chat bot you have to have a fully a more fully fledged cognitive architecture so that includes things like speaker identification so this I don't think will be in version one at least not something Beyond like you know Alexa blah blah like do this for me um because Alexa doesn't keep track of who's speaking either as far as I know um actually no I think you can you can't have users anyways point being is there's some work to do here um integration Point number five cars America in particular is a car culture and we love our fancy gadgets um so imagine that you don't need your smartphone in your car anymore that your car has an agent because your car also has a lot more juice to run larger computers um it doesn't have enough power to run like chat GPT on its own right now but I suspect that within a few years um you know companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia are going to make chips powerful enough to run chat gbt locally in your car and then of course a lot of cars have integrated 4G and 5G and 6G once it comes out so imagine just being able to talk to your car to do anything you know like find me a way around this traffic jam or uh you know take me to my favorite Indian restaurant or whatever but then moreover for anyone who's been in a minivan with children imagine how much better it'll be if your children have an intelligent entity that they can talk to instead of you because you got to focus on driving and so they can play games they can do education they have something that they can interact with because I don't know about you but as a kid the worst part about long road trips was boredom right because you're sitting there in a chair and there's nothing to do the best thing back in the day was to have you know something you could watch but that's passive right if you have something that's interactive that's going to be a lot more fun especially if it can help you play games and and that sort of thought that sort of thing so I suspect that cars are going to be a huge integration point for uh chat gbt and again it's also Universal America has like what hundreds of millions of cars on the road right like it's a brain dead simple business case put chat GPT in there give it some Integrations and see what people do with it integration Point number six uh Battlefield intelligence in the military so one of the things that occurs to me is that Technologies like chat GPT have the capacity to read way faster than humans and also can give you good ideas and brainstorming and stuff so I'm wondering if you know DARPA or other things are going to be looking at at these at llm Technologies in order to help streamline Battlefield intelligence and with recent conflicts around the world it is very obvious that Battlefield intelligence and communication is an absolute Game Changer right because you see some Battlefield participants that are still operating like the 20th century where they barely have functioning radios and they're competing against people that have satellite connectivity drones and and better command and control structures so I suspect that this kind of technology has major military applique applications on and off the battlefield right because uh sharing of intelligence and sifting through intelligence I suspect that there is a lot that can happen here um with chat GPT on top of just ordinary office work right like all militaries have clerical work which chat GPT could help them with but specifically Intel and Battlefield command and control I suspect there's probably a use case here um integration Point number seven robots so everyone's probably familiar with Boston Dynamics they have the best uh autonomous or uh you know humanoid robots right now Tesla's working on one I actually applied to Tesla to work on their Tesla bot because of my expertise in cognitive architecture they told me no um their loss anyways so uh chat uh chat GPT version one doesn't have any Integrations and it certainly doesn't know how to control a robot chassis but it's a start right you could have a conversation you've got the conversational element figured out with chat GPT but you'll need a more sophisticated cognitive architecture before you can have a humanoid robot that you can give instructions to um and say like hey can you clean up the house for me or can you cook dinner for me but chat gbt people are already using chat GPT to solve problems come up with new recipes that sort of thing and so it's only a matter of time before someone figures out you know hey let's combine this technology with robotic platforms with compliant robots um Disney I'm talking to you because you have the best compliant robots in the world you need to be working on this and Disney's going to do it anyways because they want lifelike animatronics in Disney World right so then that's only One Step Beyond that because like Disney with their with their animatronics they can interact that they want to be able to interact with guests and children that's a huge uh test bed for creating safe robots and then it's only one step further before you put it in every home and yes I very deliberately picked uh the Nestor class 5 from iRobot because what could possibly go wrong there's a lot of safety concerns here integration Point number eight video games so at the bare minimum we could have really interesting NPCs um beyond that though you could integrate chat GPT to help video game developers right because I I tell you if I knew how to use unity and unreal I would be making more video games but if I can interact with it and just say hey like build a world you know build a setting here that's like in a desert and I'm like no make it more cyberpunk no make it more you know like this and then I can I can have a natural language interface to interact with game development engines which will make game development faster and cheaper but so then so that's one possibility you can have more lifelike NPCs where you have NPCs that you can have a real conversation with um because chat GPT has a very clinical Persona right now but um you can give it any kind of persona that you want I wrote a book about this excuse me um so and then Unity on unreal were already working on gbd3 Integrations some of those were to help with like scripting and object behaviors but it's only one step further to have that integrated in real time so that you can have realistic dialogue and again it's only going to be a few years before your you know gaming system is powerful enough to run gpt3 locally and this is before we do things like um uh do lower Precision like int 8 and distillation like fine-tuning smaller models which we can already run today on on desktop Hardware VR could also be more lifelike and we'll we'll come back to that when we talk about competitors in just a minute speaking of competitors so Google immediately like the the rumor let fly like within a week after chat GPT that Google was on high alert because of chat GPT so we'll talk about Google we'll talk about Nvidia because they have in terms of competitors Google and Nvidia are probably the top because Google has palm and their other and deepmind and all their other Research into neural networks in fact Google started a lot of this with their Universal sentence encoder and other Technologies uh back in the day and I say back in the day because it was like five years ago Nvidia has their Megatron Nemo which is a 540 billion parameter model it's four times larger than gpt3 so like is that is it potentially more powerful we'll see what about meta what about IBM then there's also startups and open source so let's talk about competitors all right so the first competitor is Google so search is Google's primary business and has been forever it's like 70 plus percent of their revenue comes from search and all the AI research that they've done has branched off or has contributed to that so Bert for instance already helps Google search so in some respects chat GPT is like late to the game because Google it's like yeah we've been using large language models for search who cares and Bert is a more mature technology so I have no doubt that Google is going to come up with a solution probably come up with a better solution honestly because they're they're a much more mature tech company and they have a very very highly developed engineering core and a huge engineering core by the way um so I suspect that once Google commits its mind to something it's going to figure it out and so this is why I wanted to point out look out for the Tesla effect um Tesla has really lost its luster over the last year as other car companies one there's car startups like rivian and go EV or canoe um and then all the all the old players four GM Volkswagen um less of the Japanese companies which is really interesting a lot of Japanese car companies have been resistant to the switch to Electric anyways point being is that um there is a lot to be said for larger companies that have the experience and once they commit to something they often do it better than the startups so open AI is still a startup and so I suspect that once once companies like Google commit to competing with openai they're not going to be able to keep up um so Google is an absolute Powerhouse too we're talking about Integrations look at look up a list of everything that Google owns Google owns Nest Fitbit and YouTube just for starters I noticed that YouTube started record commending chapters and I wonder if they based it off my idea anyways so you know YouTube has been doing automatic transcripts for a while imagine what else YouTube can do with chat GPT like things imagine if you just have like a little uh chat window like where you have your YouTube concierge button it's like hey help me find a video about this this and this this is what I'm in the mood for today and it's like okay cool um you know just off the cuff idea um so yeah Google is going to be a major competitor probably the biggest competitor honestly uh next up is NVIDIA so Nvidia has the chips this is this is the one thing that really sets Nvidia apart is in when you look at the the top tech companies in the world this is one of the only like Hardware first companies um they have Cuda which uh for those who are not aware Cuda is the bindings the Integrations that allow for AI to be done super fast so they have the hardware they have the underlying hardware and they have the underlying software they also have the best algorithm people in the world um which means that they are an incredible Powerhouse and I think that um we have just woken a sleeping giant honestly um and because they sell the hard the underlying Hardware that runs AI all over the world they don't care who whose model it is right you're going to put Nvidia chips in computers and cars um they're not as much in Mobile as like arm and um Qualcomm and stuff but you know where there's a will there's a way um Nvidia really what they're focusing on is Enterprise class server hardware and so they might not Branch into Mobile but they also have their gaming division which is desktop levels so pretty much everything from desktop and larger Nvidia is probably going to dominate the AI Hardware market and again whether it's gpt3 or their own Megatron or open source models they kind of don't care it's like okay sure like AI is good it's going to run on our Hardware whether or not you use our software or our service um so now that being said if Nvidia decides to compete with chat GPT because they have the best algorithm people in the world I suspect they're going to be able to do it more efficiently right because chat GPT is not the fastest right now it's also you know it is cheap but eventually you're going to get to economies of scale who can do it for you know five cents an hour versus who can do it for a penny an hour right and it's like oh well if this company can do it for it you know five cents versus one cent that sounds like not a lot but imagine that you're a company that has 20 000 employees using chat gbt all day every day that adds up and if it's five times cheaper because of efficiencies that's gonna that's gonna be a game changer so keep your eye on Nvidia another possible competitor is meta So Meta has a very powerful AI research Branch but they don't have any service offerings so this is one of the weird things about meta is that they've got a really good AI research arm that publishes a lot of Open Source stuff and they probably consume their own uh research but then they don't do anything with it right it's kind of like how Google publishes a lot of research and then like they integrate some of it but then they let the rose the rest be open source the difference though is that meta is going all in on the metaverse and they're kind of collapsing because of it meta also has a problematic past with misusing machine learning which is in my opinion one of the primary reasons that it is uh presently uncertain is the documentaries like the great hack and the social dilemma came out and for me like that one-two punch was like yeah I'm gonna delete my Facebook account um it was just like I I knew that it was bad but I didn't know it was that bad um so meta's future is uncertain and they're doubling down on the metaverse so who knows if they're even going to be a competitor I don't think they're going to be that big um as a competitor to chat GPT another possible competitor is IBM so for many many years IBM had Watson which was supposed to be you know the flagship natural language interface that had a nice smooth voice and then it didn't go anywhere right and as far as I know IBM is shuttering Watson I don't know if it's been shut down or if they're just not investing in it until it goes away but IBM is all in on Quantum Computing um they were they were originally a hardware company I don't remember what the name was originally but one of the first products that that IBM's progenitor company did was um time cards like the physical like punching in and punching out so they have always been a hardware company first and foremost um they do that's not to say that they don't also do really good software but when you think IBM you think like okay you know IBM mainframes they have Lenovo that they sold off now they're working on Quantum Computing Hardware so you know there are the original Blue Chip Tech stock so if they decide to Pivot back towards large language models um you know they could they certainly have the horsepower to do it but there's been nothing from them yet so I don't suspect that IBM's going to be a competitor in the large language model space or chat GPT um Microsoft this is the surprise competitor so Microsoft was an early and major investor in open AI they do have an exclusive license to gpt3 but I predict and this is apropos of nothing this is not this is I have not heard any rumors of this I haven't seen any tweets or leaks this is just me thinking through okay if I am Satya Nadella the CEO of Microsoft and I have this Golden Goose that I'm partnered with what do I do right Microsoft just announced that they're going to have the an Azure offering of gpt3 and chat GPT and a few other uh similar products so they're taking it away from open AI but they have to pay open AI because it's it's a licensing model so they probably want the Golden Goose if I was Microsoft what I might be doing is working on building my own version in-house and an alternative to gbt3 a competitor to gpt3 because when you look across the landscape um Microsoft is the uh preeminent um business software company right they've got Azure they've got a huge investment in AI they know that AI is the future and so they've got this like this this partnership with open Ai and again open AI is not the most mature company they're not that they're not experienced as a vendor they're not experienced as as a tech company until very recently they were strictly a non-profit doing research and when you look at their approach to AI it is still very much like science first research first and product second or third priority which is very odd um but hey you know it's car it's carried them this far they have hypothetically pivoted to being a for-profit company so we'll see if they can pull it off um but at the at the same time Microsoft and other companies have a long history of just uh acquiring um valuable uh value valuable IP through mergers and Acquisitions um so I would suspect that Microsoft is like they they did announce that they're going to expand their uh they want they're going to get a 49 stake in open AI this is the rumor at least and I guarantee you they want 51 so they will do everything that they can to get that last two percent so that they get a controlling stake in open Ai and just absorb it um so that that that's not necessarily a competitor but the willpower is there that's why Microsoft is like Hey we're going to write you a check for 10 more billion dollars okay so let's talk about impact what does all this mean like if if there's all these Integrations that are possible and that are coming and there's all this competition what's going to happen to us and other other uh people so first I know you want to know what is the impact to our jobs so paradoxically I think the first impact is we're actually going to see a boost in jobs there's going to be an entirely new category of worker just like I had a recent uh interview with one of the world's first professional prompt Engineers that is a new category of employee that did not exist a year or two ago uh so now we're gonna have an entirely new another new category of people that can use chat GPT to be the human brain steering this really powerful tool uh we presently have a shortfall of four to five million knowledge workers I think that chat GPT maybe not version one but version 1.5 or 2 could help fill in that jobs Gap can you imagine if we just suddenly added four million more jobs like more uh more people working and these would be good like solid middle class jobs like I'm talking 50 to 70 000 a year just for a competent chat GPT user um so I think that we're going to see a very uh in the short term a big boost to uh hiring and employment now in the long run Automation and AI is still expected to destroy jobs because what happens as these Technologies mature and people get better at them you have one person that can do the job of 10. and then you have another person that can do the job of a hundred as an automator I mean this is this is why my my Twitter LinkedIn and YouTube handle say Dave shop automator um I have been someone who has automated jobs for the better more than a decade now um and so with when you have a good automator you reduce head count you know like by 10 or 20. um and then Technologies like chat GPT will Empower more people who are not as knowledgeable and skilled as I am at automation to automate more so then you have lots and lots of people automating jobs away and so one of the one of my recent videos where I talked about um you know uh I think it was um uh Financial Times or something anyways lots of people are predicting that like up to 70 million jobs or more could be destroyed in America Alone by 2030 and I think that chat GPT is going to be one of the technologies that that helps facilitate that all right impact number two a little less gloomy Let's uh let's see how Technologies like this will impact our daily life so things are going to be more convenient um our smartphones are so convenient already that we are like attached to them right so imagine if they become even more useful right right now it's kind of a dumb little box that just Waits there and gives you notices notifications that are very stressful but what if we can switch to more voice uh interface and so you don't even have a screen anymore what if the smartphone of the future is just a headset right um that you talk to and has no screen at all right and maybe a little holographic pop-up so that you can it can show you stuff when you need to or like you know smart glasses or whatever so daily life I think will be a little bit more like Star Trek where you just talk to the thing and it does the thing for you like Jarvis from Iron Man um oh and by the way this was the point of my Raven project originally was I wanted to create a ubiquitous smart assistant for everything um still the goal uh because chat gbt is obviously a long ways off from being ubiquitous being something that you can have a voice conversation with and that can solve problems for you but we'll get there so that's uh you know within it within a year or two you're gonna start seeing chat gbt and chat gpt-like Technologies being integrated into your daily life so while jobs are going away um at least your life will be more convenient um impact number three this is actually going to be really big and I did an entire video series or a long video on this is education chat GPT has the potential to completely revolutionize education so the first thing that people are worried about is cheating but that is thinking so small uh so imagine flipping the classroom where instead of the teacher lecturing to a bunch of students and they're all learning the same thing at the same time what if you flip that around and the students are all learning at their own rate the things that they are most interested in um and the things that that resonate with them and the teacher is there to help and provide feedback coaching and guidance as they need it and so the way that um I think of it is we already have a model for this and it's called Montessori education my first year of schooling was in Montessori school and looking back on it I'm like why don't why isn't School more like this even if it's not 100 Montessori like what if half of every day is self-directed for kids so that they we don't squash their sense of curiosity right uh so if you integrate chat GPT with the classroom you can have stuff like pbl which is project-based learning on steroids uh and a simpler way of thinking about it is Imagine where every classroom has one human teacher and then 30 personalized teacher aides right let's think of it this way like Chad GPT has the possibility to completely overturn education and after talking to nearly a dozen Educators over the last couple weeks um there's a huge appetite to try some of this stuff out there's also some resistance but uh you know it's such a compelling uh case I think it's going to happen all right impact number four business and economy so one thing to think about when you this is not just AI right um Ai and machine learning have been around for a while chat GPT is a new category and so what I mean by a new category is like the switch from horses to cars or the switch from you know fax machines to email right the introduction of the internet so the the bottom line is that the impact to GDP gross domestic uh product is going to be massive just by virtue of how intelligent these agents are and how much efficiency and how much horsepower it can inject into the economy so GDP goes up stocks probably go up impact to to individuals unfortunately will probably be neutral or negative unless we redistribute that wealth in my other video where I talked about um the economy and stuff I showed that uh that that worker like pay and and and the benefits that we workers reap peaked uh in like the year 2000 and it's been all downhill from there um and then depending on other metrics you look at such as the introduction of neoliberalism um worker quality of likes actually peaked in 1980. so it's been depending on how you look at it it's either been 20 years or 40 Years of stagnation total stagnation for workers despite the fact that productivity has gone through the roof so we are not redistributing the wealth uh trickle-down Theory does not work and yes I have a love-hate relationship with capitalism and neoliberalism because on the one hand I'm all for finding efficiency on the other hand I also want it to be fair anyways I'll get off my soapbox impact number five military and Industry uh so while I suspect that there can be some benefits of integrating chat GPT with helicopters and tanks and warships it's actually probably going to be negligible because uh particularly uh Western militaries modern militaries already have top of the line command and control systems they have the best cryptographics uh teams they have laser based Communications that cannot be interrupted they have redundant Communications they have autonomous uh drones all kinds of stuff so the impact the military is actually probably going to be pretty small it's just going to be another little thing that kind of differentiates um you know powerful militaries like the United States a little bit more from from developing countries and and other competitors also raw materials and Logistics and bulk Goods those are heavy right Chachi PT is not going to make them any lighter so stuff like chat GPT is only is only going to change so much like it's not going to make dump trucks you know 80 percent more efficient um that kind of thing the biggest thing I think will be lights out factories so if you're not familiar with the concept of a lights out Factory a lights out Factory is a factory that has no humans in it it is all either completely autonomous or robotic or remotely controlled and so I think that chat GPT technologies will basically make running factories like you know like Starcraft or or total Annihilation or command and uh Command and Conquer where like you have one person just like clicking on it on a robot and you tell it like go do this and the robot goes off and does the thing that you told it to um so you know I suspect that the overall the impact of military and Industry will probably be pretty pretty minimal um all right so that wraps it up thanks for watching um quick reminder uh if you support me on patreon we'll uh we'll take down the ads for good so on and so forth you know the drill thanks for watching
