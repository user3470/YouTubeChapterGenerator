morning everybody David Shapiro here with another video um this is actually a re-record because the um first one the audio wasn't good uh but before we get started I want to do just a little bit of housekeeping so first I'm starting a new mailing list um I was on I was on a MailChimp but it's too complicated for what I need um so I'm moving over to this Google form I've already got 48 responses um so this is for people primarily people who either want to invest in my startup um and or people who want to collaborate in some way or another um and then also if you just want uh generic news um links in the description um so that's that the other thing is um I did add ads I posted a poll and more than 90 percent of people were okay with ads that's perfectly fine but I'm over 5 000 subscribers now so if the 10 of people who uh were willing to support me on patreon that's five times what I have now and if I if I 5x what I've got now that puts me at 5 000 a month and if I get to there I will take down ads permanently because that's enough to support my life um right now the combination of ads in patreon is enough to support me but um honestly I see ads as a waste of time I don't want to waste your time I want to add value so if we can get to that Mark uh great and I'm not going to do Partnerships because I'm not gonna I'm not gonna waste your time by putting sponsor ads in my videos as well I want to have as much value as possible with no distractions anyways offer still on the table if we can get to four or five thousand a month I will take down ads permanently now on with the show a i and uh this was a popular topic that has been requested in a bunch of different ways um people want to know how AI is going to affect them uh their jobs and that sort of thing so here we go how will Tech like chat GPT affect your life uh there are a lot of people that are concerned about it and for good reason we will unpack all of those reasons and we will look at data in the course of this video oh by the way it's long which you probably noticed when you clicked on it with the the length and the chapters all right first let's set the stage what is the context here if you are new to the channel which many of you are um you might you might have landed here and you don't know anything about AI or specifically this current wave of AI so the the current thing is the big breakthrough was called uh an llm or a large language model it's basically autocorrect on steroids um or another way I think of it as predictive text however it is like literally millions of times more powerful than the predictive text on your phone maybe billions of times it's very very powerful now this concept might seem simple you know if all it does is predict the next word okay like how is that so powerful I won't unpack all the reasons I've got other videos talking about uh this AI but it is very powerful especially if you can accurately predict the next word in any topic and the this this uh this ability has implications in Science Education technology law medicine basically everywhere so that's the context now that we've got the stage set why now what's different and why is AI suddenly taking off so fast well if you're new to llms to gpt3 and chat GPT uh it might surprise you to know that these technologies have been around for a few years gpt3 which this is based on has been around for two years so what changed what's different uh the primary thing that changed was the UI and the ux uh so chat is a very very intuitive and familiar interface Chad has been around for many years uh decades even um and uh you know everyone especially people my age will remember things like IRC and aim um but all you young people in your tick tocks these days I don't know how that works um anyways point being we're all familiar with text messages emails and chat interfaces and so when you have a powerful enough AI attached to a familiar interface people just get it so that's why that's why it's exploding suddenly after this technology has been on the stage for two years there is another component of that and that is fine tuning that is the reinforcement learning with human feedback that helped chat GPT produce such good answers we're not going to dive into that maybe I can make another video oh by the way um one of the best ways to to for me to find the content is y'all comment and vote and comment on each other's comments because that tells me what's resonating with you guys so uh if you whatever you want a video on comment in the videos tell me and talk to each other too okay so why chat though what is what is what's the underpinning thing like okay Chad is familiar but why why is it useful so it's simple and intuitive there's no bells and whistles and knobs and levers and complexity you don't need any code you have one place of interface you have a chat window you have a text box that you enter into it's brain dead simple you can't get it wrong it's also very flexible so if you've used Chad GPD you probably have noticed that like it can like role play it can tell you about history it can help you with coding with writing all kinds of stuff so it's a simple formula that applies to a lot of stuff so because it's so simple but flexible is it kind of like a universal tool an omni tool or a Swiss army knife and we'll get we'll get into that mentality in just a minute but for instance this is why automatic cars are more popular than manual cars because they're easier to use it's that simple so low friction high usability high flexibility this is a this is a a pillar of design moving forward of AI so just keep that in mind all right so all that being said what are its limitations give me a second I need some tea so the first limitation is that chat GPT and similar Technologies are not autonomous this is there's two reasons for this one it's by design for safety and two uh we haven't done quite enough work on cognitive architectures that's one of the things that I study and research and test if you're familiar with my older work on this channel and my books so it's not autonomous that means that humans are still in the driver's seat we've got our hands on the wheels we've got our our feet on the pedals um so we're still in control it just sits there and waits uh to a greater or lesser degree you also have to know what you're doing since you're steering excuse me um and because of that interacting with these models is a new skill it's an entirely new skill set I would not be surprised if within the month you see people saying like we want to have people you know on on your resume or you know on a job description you know how to interact with language models so and any anytime there's a new skill there's a new learning curve so another aspect of that you know it's not autonomous is the brain in a jar model uh chat gbt is not connected to the outside world at all rumor has it with uh their announcement of the chat GPT professional um they're gonna change that they're going to allow for some kind of integration to something um the most obvious thing seems it seems to be the internet and there's been plenty of people out there on YouTube doing experiments of connecting chat GPT to the internet and other stuff that's honestly why I haven't done a video on it I'm like oh someone already did that you don't I don't need to duplicate this effort um so Integrations are coming all kinds of people are working on it it would be silly if openai wasn't uh but for right now it's a brain and jar which means it's kind of just locked in its own head um it also can't do everything there's lots of gotchas and gaps and you know and things that it can't do well um again lots of people studying that uh doing there's lots of people tweeting about it other videos so I'm not going to cover that in depth but suffice to say chat GPT can't do everything it can do a lot though so let's talk about what it can do what is it really good at why is it so strong um it's like a Swiss army knife of AI tools it does a little bit of everything pretty good um and when I say everything I mean like almost everything it does a lot of things that you and I can't do just by virtue of we're one person um I had a recent interview with a professional prompt engineer Anna Bernie and you should look up that video and one of the things that she said is that working with language models is like working with a toddler who knows everything so the model knows just about everything but it can only follow simple instructions that's a very very shorthand version of what she meant um and I'm not trying to put words in her mouth but that's just like that that people have quoted that to me they're like oh man like she click anyways I don't want to get lost in the weeds that was that was a quotable moment from the video so for instance it can help with coding writing brainstorming it can teach you just about anything it can help you plan it can help you overcome writer's block right and it's so simple that pretty much everyone can use it and lastly it's very cheap right it talk it costs just a few cents maybe a dollar an hour to use and so one thing that I want to point out is that um and we'll we'll get into this uh later think about how much it would cost to pay an assistant to do the things that chat GPT does for you right and that's where you see oh that's where the value is it's way cheaper than a human and just as good as a team of 10 humans all right so now let's look at the data we've set the stage you understand what's going on and why it's valuable so where is going from here now I need to warn you we're going to go way back in history because we're going to establish long-term trends to understand and unpack what's happening where are we and where are we going okay I promise we're going way back we'll start at the first Industrial Revolution uh so basically started with the steam engine invented by this dude uh named James Watt James Watt something what I think it was James Watt uh the steam engine caused a huge shift towards urbanization because suddenly there are these machines that won they weren't that portable at first they had to be in giant Factory floors but you could hook up all kinds of fun stuff to it like looms and Mills and blah blah and you no longer were dependent upon water wheels and so then you could have a lot of power wherever you wanted it and so the steam engine filled an energetic Gap and what I mean by that is that human bodies are not that good at doing labor that's why we've used horses and ox and other beasts of burden in India they've used elephants for many years because they're large and stronger and that's why we have used uh farm animals since forever to do stuff and the steam engine takes that and turns it up to 11 because all you have to feed a steam engine is coal or wood and water and suddenly it can do the work of many many like Rivers worth of water wheels or many horses or many Ox worth of Labor and it doesn't get sick and die so the efficiency is there because of the amount of energy that it can put into things Chad GPT doesn't put energy into things it puts mental labor into things but it's all different kinds of Labor so there's mechanical energy there's mental energy and so on so just keep that in mind as we move up and forward into the future so this started in the uh 18th century in the 1700s okay so fast forward 100 years as the steam engine is uh really ramping up um we are starting to get uh mechanized agriculture which leads to the Agricultural Revolution so and then you combine that with crop science uh which really kind of started um who was it the like the someone who's considered like the father of crop science I think that was around 1920. anyways point being is uh around 1840 70 percent of Americans were farmers so the mechanization of farming has completely destroyed this as a job sector now less than two percent are around two percent of Americans are farmers so farm jobs were destroyed but of course everyone will say like oh but you know technology disruptions create more jobs and we'll talk about that in the next slide but point being is sometimes a technology shift does permanently destroy a sector right keep that in mind is that mechanization pretty much permanently killed farming as a major sector of the economy that being said there are still Farmers today right there's just a much fewer Farmers overall as a percentage of the workforce okay so then let's fast forward to um so this is this is 1840 to well 2000 so almost present so let's fast forward to here the last uh 80 years or so the post-war boom so what happened during World War II was a tremendous investment in science and technology not only that um women entered the workforce in Mass because all the men were either sent to the front or were doing things that only men can do and so women were brought into the workforce to do typing to do uh Computing to do uh weapons assembly garment manufacturing all kinds of stuff and so one of the unintended consequences of World War II was first the workforce changed drastically once women got into the workforce they're like we don't want to go back home we want to stay in the workforce we like having money and having our own determination so that was a permanent societal shift but then because of the huge advance in science and technology we had a huge boost to a huge shift sorry to a service-based economy or a knowledge-based economy and that's what this graph shows so we have non-farm employees which is uh like service sector right or um or non-manufacturing right so Manufacturing Services Farm the whole economy shifted so if you remember this this one farm jobs going down service jobs and knowledge jobs going up so that's been the last Almost whole Century now um so we have a century of uh the post-war boom because of uh doing no small part due to mechanization right and then it only ramped up from there because here in 1959 and so on this is when you start introducing computers which leads to the information age so remember how I showed you that uh mechanization as you mentioned the internal combustion engine um basically destroyed farming as a primary staple of the economy um and but then what happens is you get new sectors you get one sector that pretty much goes away like um uh horse groomers right and horse drivers that went away because of the Ford Model T and and Automobiles likewise you get new things right so we replaced um people care for horses with auto mechanics and auto builders likewise the introduction of computers led to the information age which created an entirely new sector of I.T and and computer Engineers that's what I have done for the last 15 years of my career until I just retired because now I'm making enough money on uh on ads and patreon um and so again like this is another perfect example I couldn't have switched to this job before YouTube right before the internet and so technology will sometimes destroy sectors or greatly reduce them but then it will also create entirely new categories so the theory is um oh sorry premature the theory is that uh as uh technology and science Advance yes some categories will go away or be diminished but new categories will be created and those new categories will inevitably be larger than the previous ones now I want to temper this by pointing out that in that same time period where we see farm jobs going the way of the dinosaurs and service jobs going up population has also exploded right so some of what you're seeing is a function of population growth some of it is also a function of of Technology of immigration of science but one thing to point out is that population growth has been a huge driver of economic growth more more workers more producers and more consumers economy grows if the economy is flat or declines in in most Nations where that has happened the economy also stalls look at Italy look at Japan look at Greece right you look around the world to where the population has plateaued and has contracted and so has their economy so correlation does not equal causation but it's a really compelling argument so just keep all that in mind that all these growth narratives around you know Science and Technology only causes growth I don't know that I've in fully agree with that I think that population growth has been a primary driver of economic growth for the last few centuries especially when you consider that we hit our fastest period of population growth in like the 50s um and it started slowing down because we're reaching carrying capacity okay but the conclusion that the economists want you to come to right now is that new technology always creates new jobs yes it destroys some categories but it creates new categories and growth is infinite hypothetically I beg to differ so now we're going to Pivot and talk about the evidence against this narrative that technology only creates new jumps so first of all we are here this is this is a uh um this is uh as we approach the carrying capacity of the planet which is suspected to be around 9 to 11 billion maybe up to 13 billion with some more technological improvements um we are going to start uh entering into a phase of what's called economic compaction now this is a term that I have very rarely seen it's kind of a very Arcane term and I couldn't even find uh some something defining this again but I do remember reading about it and so economic compaction is basically there are more workers competing for fewer resources including jobs right and we're also going to be approaching the thermodynamic limits of things like hydrological Cycles there's only so much fresh water to go around there's only so much light to go around there's only so much arable land around and as we expand as a species to maximum capacity of our environment because we haven't gotten off Earth yet and oh by the way there is there is no other fertile soil in this entire solar system so Earth is all we got so we are we are presently facing the early stages of economic compaction which is basically it's getting crowded and we knew this whether or not we would admit it to ourselves we watch movies like The Matrix and Blade Runner um where like we have these dystopian visions of the future where everyone is living on top of each other and like we're afraid of that like we nobody wants to live like that but we kind of intuitively know that's where we're heading um and so again when you zoom out and look at the planet as a whole I don't care about macroeconomic Trends look at the total energy available to the human species look at the total amount of water and land available to the human species that's what I see driving the trends right now now if economic growth has been tightly correlated with population growth then economic growth is probably about to taper off and Plateau globally within the next 10 to 20 30 50 years who knows but pretty soon okay so if that previous narrative that new technology always creates new jobs and new categories you would expect the total employment to continue going up through the end of the 20th 20th century and into the 21st century that's not true that's not what happened labor force participation rate peaked in the year 2000. let me say that again the the the period of time where we had the most participation in the in the in the labor market in America was in the year 2000 right at the beginning of the.com Revolution right at the beginning of the the technology uh the shift towards you know you know the singularity so there's obviously this is this is this is uh there's lots of variables lots of factors they go into this and so I'm not saying that that automation or technology alone is responsible for this but if that previous narrative was true the technology always creates new categories which always result in growth then you'd expect to not see a 23-year downward Trend in labor force participation because theoretically the demand for jobs the demand for workers would be so compelling that the salaries would be so good that people would be like you know what it's worth my time but instead we have the opposite Trend we have quiet quitting we have the great resignation which I'm now a part of because I was like you know what my day job isn't worth it I'm gonna go make YouTube videos instead and that's the first time I said that out loud and wow anyways so point being a lot of us are checking out of the uh out of the conventional economy because we're just like nah it's not worth it um if you know if if my salary had gone up like and locked up with the value that I was adding my day job should have paid me like 200 000 a year but it didn't right um like I'm a freaking expert and I'm like I can go make more money on YouTube what I dealing why am I dealing with you bozos anyways sorry I'm getting lost in the weeds point being is it's not working that the theory that uh technology and science creates new jobs and new categories we have a 23-year trend saying the opposite now let's look at some more data um so I need to inform you of two categories uh one is neat and the other is nilf um and no get your mind out of the gutter I am a nilf i that means not in labor force um although since I'm starting a startup maybe I am in the labor force I'm just yeah I don't know uh anyways point being uh neat means not seeking education employment or training so anit is someone who um who has just never like I think it's typically young people but these are people that are just never ever going to even enter the workforce in the first place and then anilf is someone who has checked out for whatever reason um whether it's a disability or voluntary choice or freelancing or whatever actually I don't know I don't know if freelancing is is counted in that so maybe maybe I'm not enough sorry um long story short people are checking out of work and so let's let's just unpack this graph real quick because this is small so this is the same data we saw a minute ago which is the um the labor force participation rate and so you see it followed this big hump peaked around 2000 and it's been downhill ever since then this blue line is the uh is the ratio of not in labor force um so we have today it looks like we're approaching 96 million people um in America that are not in the labor force and this trend is not slowing down so again that narrative that the information age is going to revolutionize everything doesn't seem like it's happening so the new conclusion that I've come to based on a 23-year trend is the information age is not producing more jobs or abundance of demand for workers certainly not enough demand to have salaries rise in a in a fashion that would be compelling enough to reverse the trend of people checking out permanently well I don't know if it's permanent but people checking out seemingly permanently obviously like if you go for 23 years without a job like you got something else going on so let's talk about who's at risk if I I hope this provides a compelling enough uh argument that like okay that old narrative isn't holding up so who's at risk according to this zippya uh uh link which has a lot more graphs um we've got 25 of the population is at high potential uh for being automated away and another 35 almost 36 percent is at medium potential so that means the vast majority of workers today are at medium or high risk for being automated out of their jobs it's happening um so like you might the the first thing is like okay how do I protect myself from that um they the the there's a few things that can protect people so one manual labor does take a little bit longer to automate and the reason is because robots are not yet what's called compliant so a compliant robot here actually let me make sure that okay yes we're recording correctly okay uh so a compliant robot is something that if you push on it it can kind of adapt to Dynamic forces and pressures the leading company um uh building uh compliant robots can you guess who it is it's actually Disney because Disney has said animatronics for many many years and so ironically enough Disney might make the first fully compliant robot that's able to like do dishes with you in your kitchen um who knows we'll see um but human touch and emotional intelligence are critical and those might never be replaced so like for instance human touch is is not just um physical touch it can be you know caregiving for uh for for children um but also uh voice and emotional intelligence and communication uh so things like managers uh and and therapists and massage uh Specialists physical therapists doctors nurses a lot of jobs will be insulated against um robotic automation uh some of them indefinitely some jobs are just permanently and intrinsically better done by humans now if you work in front of a computer your job is in danger of being automated like simple rule of thumb if you work in front of a computer you can be automated away and I'm saying this as a YouTube Creator it's not going to be long until someone can just use an algorithm to synthesize voice face automatically come up with the slides that I'm doing and all all kinds of stuff like if it's if your product is video or text or email or audio like you're in danger of being automated away um now that being said those that can create and use AI tools are going to be the safest among knowledge workers which is one reason that I have pivoted my career away from it infrastructure and into AI I was like you know what AI is the next big thing so I'm going to become an expert on that okay enough said so automation has already destroyed jobs there was a graph that I that I was trying to find that it was like you know it was like um automation has created 58 million jobs in the last 10 years it's also destroyed 75 million jobs so we have a net loss of 15 million jobs or something like that um but I couldn't find that graph but I did find one that shows that we're going to lose 73 million more jobs by 2030. uh so it's like okay what happens when 73 million more people lose their jobs and that trend of people checking out of the workforce seemingly for good continues and ramps up uh are we going to end up with a labor participation rate of less than 50 percent what are the rest of us going to do how are we going to make ends meet we'll get to that the the most Salient question after all this is why not hire humans if technology increases efficiency why not hire more humans the reason is because machines are often cheaper faster and better than humans they don't require insurance no HR they don't form unions so essentially machines are the perfect employee if they break you just fix it they only run on programming and Power excuse me uh so because of that humans are just expensive to employ so I need some tea humans are expensive that's all it comes down to machines are cheaper um chat GPT costs a few dollars per hour and can replace all kinds of uh human labor already just just think about how much help chat GT can give you it's basically an executive assistant and a sidekick all rolled up into one and it knows everything so it's like how many people would you have how big of a team would you have to have to replace that labor and how expensive would it be so and this is only version one of chat GPT folks think of how about powerful this is going to be a year from now two years from now three years from now one thing to keep in mind and we're about to Pivot this video in a big way capitalism is the Quest for maximum efficiencies and humans are not that efficient that's why we moved to the steam engine that's why we built computers that's why we built tractors that's why we build machines in the first place why we build tools and that's why they are valuable despite how expensive they are and how difficult they are to build even as complex as a computer is the value added is so compelling and the efficiency is so compelling that it's easier and cheaper in the long run to use a machine than it is to use a human this principle is only going to accelerate okay that's a lot of Doom and Gloom so what's next what do we do like are we all screwed is there hope um and it seems like there's a big Paradox right if efficiency keeps going up and I should have had a chart for that in terms of like productivity per per labor hour I think the I think on average the the average labor is like 80 percent more per 80 times more productive than they were a century ago if we are 80 times more productive than we were a century ago where is all that going where is all that value that we're creating where is it going um and what can we do about it will this trend ever reverse so to answer that question we have to take a little detour into philosophy and ethics and religion uh and and economics but digress I repeat myself um so John Maynard Keynes who is the father of macroeconomics said in the 1920s or 30s that we would be we should be working around 10 to 14 hours per week by now uh we're not in fact we're working more well no I think I think uh total total labor hours peaked in the 70s or 80s um but we're still working a lot more than we should be uh and so where did this come from so this would take a really long time to unpack so I'll just recommend the book do nothing um which is very very well cited um and it talks very extensively about the political social economic and religious uh reasons behind our cultural workaholism as a culture we use fear guilt and shame to keep people working and we also uh use fear guilt and shame around laziness or idleness which means that it has been the established policy uh of of state and federal governments that people ought to be working and we ought to incentivize that behavior which means that um the the that mentality trickles down and it is implicitly embedded in all of our legislation all of our fiscal policy all of our monetary policy and then also gets embedded in the Zeitgeist of our culture where we have uh you know the hustle culture that is one of the one of the primary ways that you see it today is like if you're not working two or three jobs you're falling behind that is people who have internalized capitalism and then you end up with whenever anyone pushes back you say well who who are you to declare what's good or bad why why do you get to say that this is not good or bad Society has decided that laziness is bad so what we need instead instead of this hyper-competitive mentality is we need a post-scarcity and hyperabundance mentality which is a completely different mentality from laziness as a sin to you must be working or otherwise you're going to be condemned right so post scarcity is a hypothetical state where the scarcity of all basic goods and services uh practically no longer exists um and hyperabundance is another way it's uh two sides of the same coin stopper abundance is just another way of thinking about post-scarcity air and sunlight are hyper abundant resources air is so abundant that you never have to pay for it all you have to do is regulate it so to keep it clean enough so that everyone can use it sunlight is also hyper abundant because again you don't need to pay for it unless you're like at the North Pole where you have like Perpetual night for three months um so with massive increases in human efficiency why don't we have a post scarcity and Hyper abundant mentality um so one or I guess I I phrased that wrong we don't redistribute the benefits of offensive of our efficiency because we don't have those mentalities we'll get into how do we adopt those mentalities soon but it all basically comes down to beliefs economists have certain beliefs politicians have certain beliefs uh the the the philosophical Zeitgeist of the time gives us certain beliefs but beliefs are they're often anchored in some evidence uh but beliefs are also often arbitrary which is why I picked this graphic is just because it's like you you pray at the altar of neoliberalism or you pray at The Shrine of of capitalism and corporatism or whatever like whatever your preferred uh philosophy is um so how does that physically manifest right okay I can talk about you know Zeitgeist and philosophy and beliefs and however I want but the the the the the the the bottom line is in after after the after World War II which so the the marginal tax rates were really high to pay off the war debt so it makes sense that after the war debt is paid off tax rates go down a little bit but then they just kept cratering so what happened well around 1980 neoliberalism became the de facto uh policy globally and that was uh pushed by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan which you know two of the most powerful economies in the world we set the tone for everyone else it was also adopted by the IMF and the World Bank so with the rise of neoliberalism the belief was um you you deregulate you privatize you give people individual liberty so that they can do whatever they want with their money and the government should do less now there were some really compelling reasons for the adoption of neoliberalism because what was working what we had before then was working even worse in some respects there's a book called A Brief History of neoliberalism by David Harvey definitely recommend it because it does geneoliberalism a fair Shake but it also points out its flaws in reasoning and logic and also just where it completely goes off the rails point being is neoliberalism is the reason that we are experi is one of the reasons we're experiencing what we are experiencing today uh population growth and globalism are also reasons and there is a huge backlash against globalism right now which is very interesting to watch it play out but tax rates are just one way that you can tell that uh we have this this different mentality that goes away from uh or that it that is further from post scarcity and hyperabundance and that is I got mine screw you okay so what Drive is this I'm glad you asked nihilism nihilism is the underpinning philosophy behind all of us neoliberalism is an impure is is an intrinsically nihilistic philosophy um it also a dystopian philosophy so in the uh 19th century uh in Russia of course Russia um the nihilists said nothing matters and they were basically anarchists they wanted to burn everything down and start over the idea is spread Westward um and it really caught on you might have heard about this dude named uh Frederick Nietzsche um so he wrote extensively about nihilism and the will to power and basically invented rugged individualism and a whole bunch of toxic stuff all in one go um so as we were challenging our beliefs around religion spirituality philosophy nihilism takes over because it's like uh we can't figure out anything so just nothing matters there's physical evidence that that God exists that anyone cares about us nothing matters and the capitalist stuff stepped in and said well my prophets matter and so then everyone else was like all right sure fine profits matter uh and then now as a as a planet we optimize for GDP does that sound like how we want to live like the the the single number that everyone spends all kinds of time focusing on is GDP gross domestic product right so we've optimized for GDP we're not optimized for life we're not optimizing for Humanity we're not optimizing for anything else other than product so a century later how do we feel about that did it work we're more productive than ever but are we happier than ever all metrics indicate that happiness is cratered that we are the like in one of the most unhappy times in recorded history um and the reason is because we have this undercurrent of nihilism that says you don't matter I don't matter and then someone else comes in and fills in a narrative that says well prophets matter we saw this in memes at the beginning of the pandemic where everyone was panicking they're like but the economy and everyone's like I don't care about your economy dude like I'm gonna go die like don't tell me to reopen the economy and so that's when the uh the the cartoonishness of the Ferengi from Star Trek kind of became a little too real and that's why I picked uh picked Quark here to represent this because the Ferengi um which were invented in the late 80s I believe in first Star Trek um where a caricature of our own fixation on profits and in fact the ferangi Constitution says nothing about morality it only says about Prophets The Frankie constitution is called the rules of acquisition that is their highest religious and and philosophical Doctrine and uh let's just say it seems like it was a little too on point um so if nihilism is the problem nihilism is the underlying problem that says nothing matters I'm just going to look it out for myself the answer then is post nihilism so some people like Jordan Peterson Eugene rose and a few others have all said we need to go backwards we need to go back to traditional structures uh and their hearts are in the right place but Humanity never goes backwards and look I mean there might be fits and starts there might be temporary setbacks setbacks like you know we we struck down OV Wade so that's a setback but in the grand scheme of things we go forwards so rather than being an anti-nihilist rather than being a humanist rather than trying to go backwards and force things into you know oh let's just go back to the good old days now my recommendation is that we move forward we move through nihilism we embrace it we say yes there is some Merit here but it is insufficient this is what happened with modernism and post-modernism modernism said that there should be that Universal truths should be uh found through science and reason and experience but then as we became more globally aware we realized actually it's really hard to establish universal truth let's throw out that idea and post post-modernism said there is no such thing as universal truth it's all relative nihilism tried to say nothing matters and that is really one it's really immature two it's premature and three it's just deeply unsatisfying right like if you if you say nothing matters like are you not paying attention to the fact that like life is incredibly rare so the central tenet of post-nihilism that I propose is is that we say that all life is intrinsically valuable and that this is not a rejection of nihilism this is not anti-nihilism this is moving forward and says actually we got to the ground truth we we we we questioned what does anything mean and we exist like I am awake I am a bit of matter and energy that is aware of its own existence and when you stop to think about that that's pretty freaking cool right like just hold on to that for a minute why why is it that what separates you know some some organic matter from the rest of the universe we are extraordinarily rare and by we I mean all living things we are rare and that makes us really special so if we all agree that life is pretty cool where can we go from there what if we say like life is cool life is special we are special just by virtue of existing one of the things that I think you can you can derive from that is that we all deserve to feel it we didn't ask to be here no one can ask to be born in fact there's anti-natalism that's a philosophical uh disposition that says that assigns a negative value to birth and that antinatalism is a perfectly reasonable reaction to growing up in a nihilistic World it says hey you created me and now you don't care about me of course I don't want to be here this is this is stupid but what if instead we say all life is intrinsically valuable and therefore we all deserve to feel good and of course I can hear the internalized nihilism speaking not just in in my audience but in myself who said that anyone deserves anything and what I mentioned earlier about the arbitrariness of beliefs when you when you really boil it down all beliefs are one personal and subjective and everything is a belief whether it's your belief in science or your belief in religion or whatever you believe and it's shored up by some evidence right so we believe in science because of evidence there are plenty of people that believe in various religions based on their own their own personal evidence right there is social evidence there is empirical evidence there's scientific evidence whatever I'm about to go on that rant that Picard did like the first duty of Starfleet officers to the truth whether it's personal truth historical truth scientific truth spiritual truth whatever truth means to you it is personal it is intrinsically personal this is something that I took from post-modernism yes I agree with that but we because beliefs are arbitrary we all just say you know we're done with nihilism let's move beyond that let's go to something different and more and uh you know this could be us but we let the nihilism worms in our brain Okay so stepping away from religion and spirituality for a second empirically speaking how do we how do we move towards a more post-nihilistic world what does that look like well if Ai and automation are going to destroy 50 plus percent of jobs in the next 10 years uh we're going to need a grain Dole and for historical reference for people that aren't history nerds Rome ancient Rome had a grain dull when times got tough where they just gave out grain for free because nobody could afford it but all the wealthy Barons they produced enough and so redistribution is nothing new uh nihilism made us complacent and expect dystopian outcomes but if we change our minds if we all change our minds then we can agree that maybe redistribution it's time for this idea again it won't happen yet because we all still have that crab mentality that that that fear guilt and shame around scarcity so another way of saying crab mentality is scarcity mentality scarcity mindset so we need to get over our scarcity mindset and post nihilism the reason I say post nihilism is the answer is because it changes our orientation not just towards each other but towards ourselves one of the reasons that I quit my job my day job is because I realized I deserve to feel better than how they treated me and I think everyone deserves to feel better and when I when I discovered that it was an eye-opening it was like a major Awakening of weight I deserve to feel better everyone deserves to feel better um and then I was like yeah this is I feel like this is a universal principle and if we all believe that everyone deserves to feel better our orientation towards scarcity changes I went shopping I was when I was sick I went to the grocery store to get soup with my fiance and uh there was a guy outside asking for change and I don't carry cash and I said sorry man I don't I don't have any cash and I thought about it I was like wait I got a bag full of food like let me just give him some food um and I I walked back and I said hey man I don't have any cash but you want some soup you know like I was I was actively sick and I'm like I've got more than I need like I think that he deserves to feel good just by virtue he exists I don't care what his history is sorry I'm getting choked up [Music] I don't care what someone has been through or done if if we're here if we exist we all deserve to feel good sorry so it's about striking a balance right obviously this is a really big idea you know Mass distribution Marxism and socialism isn't the answer um it's too radical I don't think that centralized ownership the collective ownership and and centralized control is the answer um because you know the so-called experts often get it wrong look up the famines that happen in a Soviet Union because of the so-called experts deciding what to do with the Farms um so yeah like we should be we should be wary of centralized ownership we need to bank on the wisdom of masses um which which says okay we need we do need we need to we that we do need some level of Liberty and individual decision and also collective decision making not Collective ownership collective decision making Which democracy is Republic's representative democracy is a method of collective decision making neither is libertarianism or Anarchy a solution sorry um we do need structure when you've got a planet with eight billion people on it you absolutely need you need power structures now those power structures need to be fair they need to be better now I think we can probably all agree I don't want to speak for everyone but I think we can agree that individual liberty is important I like being able to decide where I'm going to work who I'm going to live with who I spend time with what I do for fun what I believe what I think so if we can all agree that individual liberty is is good then it's like okay well we don't want any hard hard left or hard right we need to be you know a little bit more reasonable a little bit more modern moderate sorry by extension I think we can agree that property rights are important and what I mean by that is I own my house my house wasn't given to me by the government I worked and I earned my house and so like it's a reward right um our brains are efficiency calculators and it's like okay well what am I if there's no reward then why am I gonna do it now this is where like okay as much as I wish that it was it was like this like Star Trek um you know says like we all work to uh for the betterment of ourselves and Mankind to be fair that's when I started that's why I started my Youtube video um was I just wanted to get information out there um but the reward is still like social validation right was like I'm doing this because I'm part of a society so anyways going down to tangent point being is that property rights are important so if individual liberty is important and property rights are important but also fairness and Equity is important my answer is we should go for a well-regulated economy keep it fair with robust redistribution that's the grain Dole idea so this idea still has to be paired with that new philosophy because our philosophy of scarcity mentality our scarcity of nihilism won't let us do that we need a new moral framework or a new disposition towards not just each other but towards ourselves in order to achieve this so thank you all for watching be kind it's already hard enough take care
