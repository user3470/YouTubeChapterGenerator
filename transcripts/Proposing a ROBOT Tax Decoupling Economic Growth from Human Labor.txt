hey everybody David Shapiro here with a video today's video is going to be a slightly different flavor from what I normally do still centered around artificial intelligence so what I'm going to do today is I'm going to talk about a robot tax this is a proposal that I've been kind of cooking around on the back burner but I figured it's time to talk about it so the agenda for today's video is first let's talk about the economic impact of AI and automation why is it that we even need to talk about redistribution and a robot tax next we'll talk about what is this proposed robot tax how does it work uh we'll build a case for it say why we need it and then we'll also look at some of the objections around potential robot tax and then we will recap the video so automation has already destroyed a lot of jobs it has created some jobs but it has created fewer jobs than it has destroyed this trend is only accelerating and this is despite what some tech CEOs say for instance Sacha Nadella recently said that you know Technologies like being AI is going to create more jobs um I disagree and I think he knows that but it's just a super unpopular thing to say that AI is going to destroy jobs because we don't have an answer yet we don't have a solution and so if you say if you come out and say oh yeah you know AI is going to destroy 50 of jobs in the next 10 years that's a super unpopular move um but the bottom line is that machines are cheaper than humans that's all there is to it and part of capitalism part of the free market economics is to find efficiencies if machines are more efficient than humans then companies are going to use machines it's that simple so Industrial Automation in the form of Robotics is already doing this even before modern AI now looking forward AI has the potential of destroying more than 60 percent of American jobs so my personal prediction is that we're going to see 70 unemployment by 2030. so what happens when most Americans lose their job permanently we basically have two options there's going to be riot in the streets or redistribution of wealth and if basically the redistribution is coming it's just whether or not the riots happen first so what we'll need to do is adopt an abundance mentality and get rid of our scarcity mentality basically right now everything is a zero-sum game and we have this crab mentality that says you know what I got mine to heck with everyone else but instead we will need to decide collectively if we want to redistribute some of the value created by the rise of Automation and AI so what do I mean by this it is forecasted that GDP will rise faster than it has ever risen thanks to AI we're talking trillions upon trillions of dollars of GDP growth this is good for capitalism I mean there's no other way of of describing that the best thing to happen to capitalism in the history of capitalism will be artificial intelligence the question becomes who gets to capture that value and why basically we have the choice of moving towards a cyberpunk hell or a solar Punk Utopia and it's literally just a choice there's nothing forcing it to go one way or the other so with that said this is what I mean by robot tax redistribution of benefits from optimization Technologies or alternatively redistribution of benefits obtained through automation not really sure if I like that a bolted on at the end but the idea is we're redistributing the benefits of AI and automation all right so what is this robot tax it is a comprehensive proposal that is sort of like a Ubi a universal basic income but one of the key differences between a robot tax and a Ubi is that it's not an entitlement one problem with entitlement programs is that they're not intrinsically funded unless you bolt a tax on with it such as like Medicare tax so rather than just saying everyone is entitled to a stimulus check every month what if we have it so that it's actually tied directly to a tax system attack structure that means it is automatically self-funded kind of like how we have sales tax um or gasoline subsidies so we've got plenty of examples of taxes and subsidies that are that are grafted onto our economy um with very specific purposes so if we do it this way it's Superior to a Ubi and that it's not just a fixed rate it's actually going to be directly proportional to how much impact AI has had on the economy so one thing that this does that the robot tax does is it incentivizes economic gains through automation Ai and actually job displacement so what I mean by this is that the robot tax actually encourages people and companies to replace human labor basically this is a new paradigm of thinking about it saying it's actually good if we decouple economic growth from the primary constraint of human labor and we should reward companies for doing this and then also reward people if they help you know automate their jobs away or if they get their job automated away out from under them because then they're they're liberated to work on other things so rather than fight this trend we should embrace it right you know you may there's there's no stopping a rising tide there's no changing you know a macro economic Trend this powerful by going ahead and working on a robot tax we're going to protect citizens not just workers all citizens by ensuring that all citizens get a slice of this this rapidly growing pie and it will also help Shepherd in a new way of living a post-labor way of living and furthermore it protects National Security by incentivizing AI research America is presently falling behind some of our key uh geopolitical competitors this is dangerous for us and we should be living leading the charge all right so how does this robot tax work it's similar to a vat or a value-added tax and also I need to add a caveat that this is just my current way of thinking and I am not a tax expert nor am I an economics expert I just read some books on on the topic and this is what this is the idea I got so basically we should Target goods and services that are produced efficiently with AI and automation this will raise the price of those goods and services a little bit kind of like how um how gas subsidies or gas taxes raise your price at the pump but at the same time Ai and automation will drive down the price of those goods and services so the net effect is that we'll still see lower prices for the goods and services we consume that are produced with AI and some of that consumption-based tax will then be redistributed to everyone else it could also include uh tariffs incentives and exceptions so for instance we could include uh protections for small businesses and essential Industries maybe those could have exemptions so that they don't get disproportionately impacted so for instance Health Care might be one of the primary industries that we accept from this although I will say Healthcare is one of our Prime our most expensive things so maybe we should actually double down on incentives in the healthcare industry let's automate as much of the health care industry as we can to drive costs down again this is there's some room for discussion here another thing is we could use this policy to incentivize de-globalization so deglobalization is a whole Trend unto itself and we'll talk a little bit more about deglobalization in a later slide but through tariffs incentives exemptions and exceptions we could also advance that initiative which will further reinforce National Security interests um and again we can reward companies that Advance this initiative so for instance if we give companies tax breaks or other tax incentives for increasing automation so for instance if they are able to double their output with the same head count or fewer employees they should be rewarded for that because again the goal is to transition from a labor-based sorry labor-based economy to a post-labor market um so that is those are some of the ideas of of how I imagine a robot tax could work okay so now let's talk about let's let's build a case for this robot tax so number one Ai and automation is coming whether you like it or not like there's nothing we can do to stop it you can't regulate the stuff out of existence it the cat is already out of the bag so with that in mind we have an opportunity to decouple economic productivity that's GDP growth from the primary constraint of human labor the magnitude of this is difficult to overstate uh but I'll try um another thing is everyone needs to eat like we have seen what hunger and Desperation does around the world and if people lose their livelihood and there's nothing to like save them or prop them up there will be riots that's all there is to it we also need to stay at The Cutting Edge of AI else we will fall behind and that is not in anyone's interest so let's hit two birds with one stone let's Shore up national interests National Security and corporate interests as well as the private interests of all citizens okay so what is the robot robot tax do what is a what is a what is a case for it one is it promotes innovation in general we believe that Innovation is good this is one of the the cornerstones of free market economics of capitalism and neoliberalism is that the Quest for efficiency the Quest for economic efficiency incentivizes uh technological advancement so why don't we just lean into this and reward it so if we reward companies for making this transition for helping It Happen by you know giving them tax breaks or whatever and displacing some of that tax burden to the people consuming their goods and services that will uh help reinforce this cycle of decoupling economic growth from Human labor because humans are expensive that's all there is to it I've said it again and again economic growth this is the biggest carrot for some people whether you're a corporation or a shareholder whatever you want to see GDP growth GDP growth go up sorry you want to see your stocks go up I get it you know um I want to see the same thing I'm a shareholder in my own startup I want those prices to go up at the same time I don't want to hurt anybody so what I'm trying to do here is to uh propose something that'll strike the balance and meet everyone's interest um I'm gonna keep ringing this Bell decoupling economic growth from Human Labor uh will create a economic Paradigm hitherto undreamed of thanks Doctor Strange um it's it is difficult to imagine this Paradigm um at the beginning but one thing that you can do is think about how fiat currency decoupled monetary policy from the gold standard a lot of people think that we should go back to the gold standard but the the economic Convention of fiat currency was brilliant and we can do the same by decoupling human labor from economic growth National Security so this is another topic that I know that a lot of Voters and politicians care about and as I was exploring this it occurred to me that actually leaning into AI is a huge a primary National Security interest we already see this with the chips act uh which was a bill that was recently passed that had to do with um export control and a few other aspects but think of it this way if we lean into AI then our Industrial Automation capacity and our manufacturing capacity goes through the roof and the ability to manufacture Goods whether they are helicopters and tanks or or even just stuff that we need cars all of that it Shores up our national security especially if we bring it all back onshore um data information and intelligence the smarter our machines become the more secure we are as a nation and this include this is not just America that I'm talking about this includes all of our allies across the world excuse me and one thing that I need to point out is that this competition already exists I'm not making this up it's already out there I watched a um an interview with Admiral aquilino a four-star admiral of the of the Pacific Theater and he like you know the Department of Defense this is already on their radar so the rest of us also you know can participate self-reliance as a nation is a rising Trend as is deglobalization there are three primary reasons for this one is the pandemic the pandemic showed just how fragile Global Supply chains are and it will still take years to untangle those finally Russia and China despite Decades of neoliberalism and Global policy they're still not playing nice like that's all there is to it it is a failed experiment Globe like globalization saying bring everyone to the table of democracy and and liberalized free markets didn't work so now the rising trend is towards deglobalization which says actually maybe we need to be a little bit more insular and maybe we need to bring stuff onshore and this is already happening by the way there are huge projects of bringing chip manufacturers on back onto U.S and European soil so this is already happening and then from a more direct military uh uh perspective the United States Air Force recently tested a fully automated F-16 no pilot um and then of course there's Ai and drones it's coming the military is doing it so the rest of the economy also needs to participate and and make sure that we are in lockstep on this topic okay so I feel like I've outlined a really compelling argument to work on a robot tax to incentivize Ai and advancement and also to shore up um you know the citizenry now let's talk about some of the potential objections that you uh voters politicians and companies might have so first governmental overreach obviously there are plenty of people out there who believe that smaller government is better this is classical conservatives and Libertarians and some progressives as well um number two unintended consequences what could go wrong number three difficulty implementing nothing like this has ever been attempted so it's going to be hard number four Market distort distortions and inefficiencies we might accidentally create problems that don't exist today and then five finally moral concerns around rewarding people for not working basically so number one governmental overreach why does the government need to be involved at all it's true that a totally free market will reduce prices of goods and services with AI it's happening it's already happening you look at how cheap Technologies like chat GPT are and how powerful they are for twenty dollars a month I have a tool that accelerates everything that I do by a factor of 4 or 10x like so as a writer just as a as a quick aside as a writer I use chat GPT to help me brainstorm and plan chapters I do that for a few minutes it is like worth several hours of talking to other writers um and then I sit down and I can write a 4500 chapter a word chapter in one sitting with the with the help of AI this is an entirely new paradigm so AI is already making things cheaper better faster and so on so why does the government need to get involved the problem is that many people will be permanently unemployed and we don't know how bad it's going to get what if all of like what if nobody ever makes money from writing fiction ever again we're already seeing a huge Trend towards AI generated art and whether or not that's fair it kind of sucks and so if people become permanently unemployed consumers will have a reduced ability to participate in the market and that's just bad for the economy consumers need money in their pocket in order to spend it that's all there is to it if consumers don't have money they can't spend it and the economy slows down so therefore we need at least some government intervention to ensure that um that consumers have money to spend it's that it's that simple it can be measured through velocity of currency that is basically how long um every dollar stays stationary before it's spent so keeping the velocity of currency up by taxing redistributing and then putting it back in the in the hands of people that are going to spend it almost immediately that's generally good for the economy and a robot tax could help uh help with that unintended consequences so rather than talking about the unintended consequences let's talk about the known consequences of having hungry desperate and angry citizens the January 6th riots a couple years ago already demonstrate just how angry people already are one thing that a friend of mine pointed out was that both sides of the political Spectrum have been really upset left right A lot of people are really angry and that's only going to get worse if we start to see record levels of unemployment we have record levels of unemployment right now but the cost of inaction is staggering the cost of an action is potentially monumental so that means we should proceed with some kind of what I propose is the robot tax because again the cost of doing nothing is probably much higher than the cost of any unintended consequences now that being said we shouldn't be Reckless because we absolutely could make it worse so we should proceed cautiously but with Clarity of intent and finally any unintended unintended consequences can be mitigated by experimenting and modifying the robot tax as we go so for instance it could be implemented slowly and scaled over time on the topic of how difficult it is to implement there's a lot of problems with this so one how do you measure the economic impacts from Ai and automation how do you know how much to tax these goods and services because we don't want to disincentivize Ai and automation right like that would have the literally the opposite effect if we tax it too much then people are going to say actually let's just keep the human laborers and maybe that can be a deliberate step to slow down the deployment of AI and automation maybe we do tax those at a certain rate and in order to mitigate how fast the change is but at the same time we don't want to stifle innovation so it's a very delicate balance to strike there and then how do you decide which goods and services get taxed and how much because if it's going to take you know if you have to fill out forms or get inspections and get certified this that or the other that's a lot of work so maybe that's why I say maybe a vat vat tax is the is the best way so that uh so that basically you know it's a point of sales tax it might also be easier or better to tax the companies that lay off employees so for instance if an employee gets laid off due to getting automated out of a job maybe that's where you tax it but then you create an incentive to change hiring practices and this is one place that I agree with neoliberalism let let the labor market shape itself but then you you tax probably at the point of consumption again I'm not an expert but this is kind of the best that I've got at this point and finally how do you decide who gets how much should it be Universal and equal like the you know the idea of a universal basic income but then you ask a question what if a high earner gets mechanized mechanized out of a job isn't that a little bit unfair like what if what if someone who is like I was an I.T professional making six figures what if I got mechanized out of a job and then it's like oh here's a you know 800 a month um you know as opposed to the nearly ten thousand dollars a month uh that you got before like that seems deeply unfair so there are many questions around unfairness especially as more and more white-collar workers get mechanized out of a job but then also look at the artists look at the writers and graphic artists that are already struggling and already being harmed by this so uh it's gonna be indiscriminate basically uh so this is this is a this is a pain point of implementation but I'm not saying that this is a barrier to implementation it's just going to take some wrangling and negotiation something a little bit more abstract is the concept of market distortions and inefficiencies if the robot taxes improperly implemented it could incentivize gamifying or rigging the system one of the best examples we have of this is corn and oil subsidies so corn subsidies have and soybean subsidies have meant that a lot of farmers just keep planting soy and corn even if it's not needed because they they know that government will guarantee a rate for them ditto for oil subsidies so creating subsidies or perverse incentives can create a lopsided Market that is actually kind of paralyzed and is not adaptive so we need to be really careful that whatever we do around a robot tax doesn't create a lopsided or paralyzed Market another example of how this kind of thing can go wrong is the well-intentioned PPP loans the paycheck Protection Program loans that happen during the pandemic they were right they were super inefficient and they were Rife with abuse um but an example of something that did work were the stimulus checks so I at the time I made too much money so I didn't get a stimulus check but a lot of my friends did and it was like magic like they just woke up and there was an eleven hundred dollar check in their bank account or however much it was I guess it varied from person to person so we have a model for just depositing money um very efficiently into people's bank accounts it can be done now of course that that assumes that someone has a bank account and not everyone does especially the most um uh disempowered and disenfranchised people many of them don't have bank accounts um but at the at the end of the day we will need to be very careful about incentivizing the behavior that we actually want to see and I as far as I can tell there are three primary um places that we need to look at Behavior one is corporations companies what Behavior do we want to that do we want to incentivize companies like I said earlier in the video I think that what we should incentivize is that transition to a post-labor market to to decouple um corporate profits from Human labor um then what do we what what do we want to incentivize consumers to do well we want consumers to consume right that is just a a baseline Assumption of neoliberalism is that you want consumers to spend money the best way to get consumers to spend money is for them to feel safe and secure so that they know that they can spend the money that they that they have if people don't feel safe and secure they save and that's bad for the economy right because if you're if you're waiting like to get health care if you're waiting to buy a new car if you're waiting to fix out your home because of uncertainty that's not good so if we can use the robot tax to one incentivize companies to move towards a post-labor economy and then also give consumers the confidence to spend and not and not need to save imagine that the need for retirement savings goes away permanently that's the that's the future I want to live in where we all have so much Financial Security that we don't even need to think about saving and then finally how do we want the market as a whole to behave and by market I mean the goods and services markets and then also the labor market um there will almost certainly always be a need for some human workers um whether it's the AI researchers at least until AI takes over its own research um you know uh Child Care education um some aspects of medicine we will always need to have some human workers and so we don't want to disincentivize all people from quitting permanently but that being said we also want to support the people that can no longer work finally moral qualms one of the biggest uh uh rejections of things like ubis what do people deserve you know you don't deserve anything unless you work hard so this goes back to the founding of America with our Protestant work ethic which basically says laziness is sinful I've made plenty of other videos about this so I won't get too too deep into it but we do need to address the elephant in the room there are plenty of people who say if you don't work you don't deserve anything that if you don't work you should be punished for it there are I mean there are plenty of people just go on the internet there are people who say that it is immoral to be lazy to be unemployed and that it should be uncomfortable that that the incentive to get back to work should be there and it should be uh painful to be unemployed I don't think that I don't think that that's fair I don't think that people deserve to be in pain or to be scared if they lose their job to Ai and automation so we can talk about morality but I'm just as eager to flip that script and turn it around and say actually maybe it shouldn't be maybe people shouldn't be punished maybe people shouldn't be scared and Afraid and hungry maybe using maybe using those negative incentives you know that that that threat of Abandonment maybe that's not the kind of society we should build now another argument is well if people don't need to work won't they become lazy and useless don't we need an occupation to even have our identity um from my personal experience I quit my day job a month ago no absolutely not um it is an absolute myth that we need work in order to feel um alive or to have an identity that is a total fabrication that the establishment tells you because again the economy has been driven by the need for human labor but if we decouple human labor from the economy then you know the capitalists won't care it's like go do whatever you want right as long as as long as consumers have money and they spend it the capitalists won't care so the myth that you need an occupation that you need a job to stake your identity on total lie absolute fabrication that being said humans love challenges we need to feel a sense of Mastery and competence that's why people play so many video games a video game is a is a carefully curated challenge a lot of people do gardening they learn about gardening or they work on cars right whoever whatever we all find stuff that makes us feel alive and engaged and we don't need a job to do that that being said there will still be economic incentives to do things like start a business or find other ways to contribute it's just that it won't be absolutely necessary to find a job in order to live right and in fact one thing that many Ubi Studies have found is that with that Baseline level of security people often get more creative and find better ways to contribute sometimes they go get better education or they contribute back in their community in various ways they volunteer more doesn't matter the point is is that once people have a baseline level of security they often do more for the economy and because of this the market might end up more flexible and more efficient with the robot tax so imagine that we allow people to leave jobs that aren't working for them and that incentivizes companies to replace them with machines anyways but then if you have a huge pool of surplus labor whenever they're needed that is going to be really really good for the economy because a surplus of Labor will drive down prices the cost of Labor which will then provide more benefits because cheaper labor means more investment and also bringing more stuff back onshore remember deglobalization so I think if the robot tax is implemented correctly we're going to get compounding returns all right so in conclusion AI is coming that's all there is to it AI is going to be really good for the GDP and by extension it's going to be really good for stocks that being said we probably need to figure out a way to share the paradigm shift that we're facing is completely new we have never seen anything like this and the key thing the key fundamental aspect of this is that we have an opportunity to decouple economic growth and output from the biggest constraint right now which is human labor so with all that said thanks for watching I hope that this resonates with you um and uh yeah talking in soon
