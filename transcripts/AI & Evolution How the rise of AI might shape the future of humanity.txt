okay hey everybody David Shapiro here with a video um by popular choice we are covering Ai and evolution will we become something else let's take a deep dive uh real quick just a few seconds I want to plug my patreon I am most of the way to my goal of five thousand dollars a month from patreon supporters once I get there I will demonetize all my videos permanently um because I hate ads it's a waste of time um also what you get if you do support me on patreon is this is the primary way that I interact with people I updated the tiers so depending on how much interaction you want whether you just want to ask a couple questions or even if you want me to go so far as like looking at a proposal or a code the higher tiers I will be happy to um to look at anything that you're working on so long as it doesn't conflict with any ndas that's my only caveat is if there's anything that I have signed that I'm not allowed to share I'll let you know but beyond that if you want to interact with me um patreon is the best way to do so I also generally accept all LinkedIn connections but I don't always chat on LinkedIn so all right with all that out of the way here's the overview of what we're going to talk about today so first whenever you talk about Evolution you really got to set the stage and address any assumptions that you're making otherwise people are going to be a little bit lost because Evolution means different things to different people so I just want to add some framing so we'll start by talking about evolutionary pressures which is what drives evolution in the first place second we'll talk about tools and fire we have been tool makers for a very long time and so what I want to do is use this as an example to show you how technology has already modified our evolutionary trajectory fast forwarding we'll talk about mechanization in the industrial revolution and how Technologies like airplanes and tractors have already impacted our Evolution now that's just setting the stage again we'll jump into various AI Technologies so crispr I know is not is not strictly a uh AI technology but Alpha fold is and those two go together like peanut butter and jelly so we'll talk about how these Technologies might have a very direct impact on Evolution next we'll talk about whether or not AI is going to make us smarter or Dumber this is a question that comes up a lot with tools like chat GPT a lot of people are thinking man this is going to make all of us Dumber maybe we'll we'll uh take that apart uh once we get there uh next we'll talk about post-scarcity so basically what happens if AI means that we don't have to work anymore uh how does that change our relationship to each other to ourselves and how might that influence our trajectory in evolution um the last AI topic will be AI in dating so from an evolutionary perspective this is called mate selection or sexual selection so how will AI impact who we choose to have children with because that is one of the primary drivers of evolution and finally we'll touch on the ethics and ramifications of all this stuff what are the pros and cons of allowing AI to influence our evolution okay so first we've got evolutionary pressures for those not in the know evolution is was defined super simple as uh if you have variation and selection you must have Evolution that were those were the words of Charles Darwin the father of our modern theory of evolution and of course this theory has panned out so far so good it stands up to pretty much all scrutiny there are a lot of nuances I can hear some people already saying well actually we're not going to go into the nuances of evolution point being though is species change over time now the primary uh method of evolution is what's called natural selection so natural selection uh you might have heard survival of the fittest which basically so fittest is not like physical fitness not like how like jacked you are it's how well you fit into your evolutionary role so our fitness um and oh and fitness is primarily measured by number of viable Offspring so if an If an organism has more viable Offspring it is said to have higher Fitness that is how that is the primary indicator that is the kpi if you want to use a technology term of Fitness the more babies you have that make it to adulthood and also procreate the higher your Fitness um has it has nothing specifically to do with adaptation because individuals cannot adapt but a species can adapt as a whole over time through higher Fitness sexual selection which I just mentioned a moment ago is who you choose to have children with this is a really uh interesting way so uh the the evolution of of gender or or sexual differences was a really powerful Innovation and there's a reason is because it allows for really quick recombination rather than cloning which is much slower and that's how like bacteria evolved although I will say that there are plenty of bacteria that have lateral Gene transfer without sexual reproduction but sexual reproduction has immense benefits for um evolution and that's why it's that's why it's here gene flow so gene flow is as populations move you get admixture or you get different um you you get a different genetic populations and they change over time so that's gene flow genetic drift is how genes might change within a population over time um based on uh in inter species competition so competition between one species and another that can cause genetic drift or intra species component competition so that's competition within the species can also cause genetic drift so that the species itself might have some kind of sexual antagonism like peacocks and P hens so peacocks have their big giant plumage they probably didn't always have that and so sexual selection genetic drift within that population cause them to get the plumage which actually is a maladaptive peacocks with their big plumage are more likely to get attacked and eaten so there's a huge cost to that and then finally mutation so one thing that that's really important to remember is that a lot of evolution and a lot of genetic variation has nothing to do with mutations I think I read a while ago on average um the the average like human child has only 30 total genetic mutations from their parents out of what is it three billion genes or whatever I don't remember or three billion base pairs I think we have 30 000 genes and about 3 billion base pairs so out of all of that we only have 30 unique mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms snps and so that tells you how efficient and reliable our genetic copying uh uh um Machinery is but it does happen and so genetic mutations are very very slow however genetic recombinations are much faster which is why sexual selection is such a Powerhouse when it comes to Evolution it is definitely op I would love to see a tier zoo video on how on sexual reproduction versus asexual reproduction anyways I'm That Kind of nerd okay so that is how natural selection happens but what are the pressures that drive Evolution first food food is absolutely the number one most powerful driver of evolution because if you don't have food you starve so the more things you can eat or the better you are at getting finding and controlling food the better you do humans are apex predators and omnivores we can eat just about anything we can even eat poisonous stuff because we can figure out how to cook it and make it not poisonous like look at puffer fish and um and plants from the nightshade family and all kinds of stuff we can domesticate crops cereal crops grains we can domesticate cows we mastered food and be and we'll get in we'll get into more details on that later um so actually I'll stop myself there environmental change is another huge huge driver of evolution as the climate changes it gets hotter it gets warmer it gets colder drier wetter whatever those those create immense pressures on species and individuals and you can have sudden environmental changes so like you might have um a period where with a lot of volcanic activity which puts particulates in the atmosphere which usually causes global cooling not always but usually you can also have changes in solar behavior um it has been hypothesized that Earth's position in the solar system and in the Galaxy actually changes our exposure to things like cosmic rays over time so there are cyclical um uh uh extinctions that happen every now and then and they're so regular that it looks like maybe it has to do with like where we are in the cosmos excuse me so that can be an example of an environmental change stuff from way way out in space might impact evolution and then on a more mundane level predation we don't have to worry about that because we are the predators now but certainly other animals and ancient humans had to worry about getting eaten by like bears and saber-toothed tigers and stuff disease that is still a big one so who is susceptible to what diseases whether they are autologous diseases so cancer is an example of a disease that comes from within or it's an external disease like flu and viruses and and uh MRSA methicillin resistant staphylococcus right so diseases your resistance to disease one of the biggest drivers of human evolution was the Black Plague which actually since it killed 30 like a third of all population in Europe what it did was it left the people who were just happened to me more genetically uh resistant to those diseases and so it's what's interesting is that every now and then archaeologists will excavate um some uh like uh pits from around you know the Dark Ages or even going back to the Roman ages and they'll find bacterium that they think were were the cause of the plague and when they identify the species of bacterium it's like this doesn't even cause a skin rash today and so that tells you that Evolution because of our travel our globalization we get exposed to so many diseases and we have actually evolved to be so much more resistant to disease that like I always laugh because um every time travel movie if you even go back 50 years you will be the bringer of death you will be the plague Bearer um let alone if you go back 500 years everyone you meet if you go back in time will die because the the the bugs on your skin and in your like body will kill everyone so don't do time travel kids that's probably why we don't have any time travelers from the future even if time travel is possible in the future they'd be like um no we if we go back we're going to kill everyone that is how much our Evolution has progressed in terms of Immunology just in the last few hundred years and then finally competition I already talked about um inter and intro species competition so I don't need to go over that okay so with all that in mind you are now primed to understand what drives evolution so talking about humans specifically we are the tool makers we make and use tools and have been doing so since Paleolithic times since even before modern humans Homo sapiens sapiens we have been tool makers and Tool users whether it's Stone bone wood threads whatever what now this our ability to use tools required fine motor control so that fine motor control is controlled in the brain stem and cerebellum but it also requires more planning and thinking ahead so in the book um on task he they he talked the opening I think is the introduction of the first chapter talks about how using tools finding materials this requires a lot more cognitive control which uh cognitive control happens in the prefrontal cortex so our entire brain from the from the most primitive structures to the most sophisticated structures go into tool making and Tool use now what does that do for us and how does that shape Evolution one of the primary things that it does is it gives us access to new food so if we if we come up with a bow and arrow and suddenly we or or a spear and we can take down a woolly mammoth a woolly mammoth has like a billion calories I don't know if it's that much but like let's say let's let's just assume that a woolly mammoth has millions of calories right that's enough to feed your entire Village for like a month um I don't know if that's how long it lasts but basically having new dietary options really changes your evolutionary trajectory and because we had such a huge advantage of tool use Evolution doubled down on that and so it's like hey we just unlocked this new skill tree so let's keep spamming that skill tree because it's a really good one tool use overpowered another thing that we did was we mastered fire so fire does a lot of things for us one it allows us to cook food which again expands our dietary options even further so between tool use and fire that's why we are omnivores we can eat everything now that being said our because cooked food is easier to eat and digest our stomachs became less acidic our Jaws became smaller as did our teeth and weaker and all of that also spoke to um we were already social at least we think we were already social but um communal hunting efforts and Gathering efforts and then agrarian society had huge social implications and so tools and fire probably helped drive all the genetic Machinery that eventually gave rise to civilization and then social like Civilization and social tribes social units that is another driver of evolution because you have to be smarter in order to learn language for instance because at some point in the in the ancient history we didn't have a language but at some point we did get language and so that was an evolutionary thing where it's like okay how do you squish air out of your face and then make like you know meaningful sounds that someone else can understand that I I could make tons of videos on this this has been like I've read books about this forever and talked with people so anyways um once once you get more sophisticated around tool making and Tool use that unlocks a whole new skill tree you can make clothes you can make shoes which uh thick clothes that allows you to get out of hot climates and into cold climates that you otherwise couldn't survive in it allows you to build uh huts and boats and all kinds of stuff that allows you to continue to expand across the globe so tool use and Fire are like super overpowered and that is why humans are we're a global species even before we had modern technology okay we were already Global but you fast forward to the Industrial Revolution we invent uh steamships airplanes airliners uh and and Industrial Agriculture and this continues to influence Evolution it's too soon to really say like oh this is the way that it's going to impact Evolution but it absolutely is and so uh remember how gene flow is one of the um one of the drivers of evolution when you can be born in India and then move to America or vice versa you can literally go Halfway Around the World start a family then your kids can go elsewhere you can you know like there's people on the East Coast that go to the West Coast there's people that go to Europe and Europeans come here go to Africa Australia whatever so we have more gene flow in the human species than we have ever seen and it is impossible to predict how that's going to happen or or how that's going to impact Evolution but it absolutely is it also allows for invasive species so just as an example of how mass transit Global Transit can impact Evolution when you in when you introduce an invasive species whether it's on accident or on purpose it will have an impact on the local ecology so humans we are an invasive species at least that's one way of looking at it are cats domestic cats are one of the worst invasive species oh and by the way they exist on every continent including Antarctica um I think though that the cats on Antarctica if humans were to leave Antarctica the cats would probably all freeze and starve but there's plants in the South we have Kudzu that's an invasive species that came from Asia there's invasive bugs there's the pine beetles and Oak beetles and whatever else that are killing other things and then there's frogs and cane toads these all impact their local ecosystem by modifying um ecological equilibriums and that sort of stuff now from a human perspective what we are seeing is what you might call a mutt right I remember I was on OkCupid probably 12 years ago and there's a a girl who called herself an Eastern European mutt and I'm just like okay cool um but basically because of this this you know we've had about a century and a half of global Transit um where you know it's it's even cheaper today where almost anyone can travel thousands of miles to start a new family um this creates what's called heterosis so heterosis is basically hybridization which um this often masks or uh reduces the expression of genetic diseases and so like if you if you take someone who is from a particular population like sub-Saharan Africa they might have certain uh predilections towards certain diseases like maybe diabetes or whatever but then if the if you take that sub-Saharan African and let's say they have children with a uh you know a northern European person and their children are a perfect hybrid of these two very distinct genetic populations that child is very likely to be healthier than either parent we see this in dogs so this is why mutts are much healthier than purebreds and this is why I will pretty much never ever adopt a purebred dog um you know my dog that you sometimes see in my videos he's 12 years old and still runs at full speed and he has his hearing he has his sight whereas a German Shepherd which is part of what he is would probably be dead by 12 years honestly so heterosis good thing overpowered so get on an airplane do your species a favor and find an exotic person to have children no don't do that I'm not telling you what to do just pointing out that heterosis is a good thing and actually it is suspected that this is why we have this is for both men and women why we find exotic people more attractive is because it's like ooh she's pretty she doesn't look like the local girls I want some of that and then same thing for uh for women too I remember I watched a video many years ago of an American woman who went to Japan and she was talking about like I'm I'm exotic now this is weird all the Japanese men like me because like I'm you know I'm I'm the white one it's very interesting so point being though is there is some genetic reason um and benefit to being interested in exotic people now that being said don't objectify people you're like don't just try and get a notch in your belt um so we're already touching on the the ethics and stuff anyways moving right along um industrialization had a lot of impacts above and beyond Transit there was um mechanized agriculture so with the Advent of modern agriculture industrial uh scale agriculture we suddenly had way more calories than ever before part of the reason that we did this was actually um during World War II the United States Army they created a schedule of like measuring um uh recruits based on their like physical strength stamina weight height everything and what they found was that a lot of Americans were actually too malnourished to even join the Army and the military was like yeah that's no good uh in in case of future Wars we need to make sure that we have a lot of you know strong young healthy men in order to recruit them and so what they did was in the aftermath of World War II there was a lot of nutrition uh programs that's actually one of one of the reasons not the only reason but one of the reasons that we have corn subsidies still was because it's like hey a lot of a lot of these kids a lot of these young men are too skinny because they didn't get enough calories so we need to get everyone up to grade a which means we need cheap efficient calories and one of the ways that we achieved that was through corn subsidies and the invention of high fructose corn syrup which turned out to be a double-edged sword because high fructose corn syrup is not the best metabolically speaking um so but all that being said that was an unintended consequence of solving the calorie problem which we're now figuring out right we are we're getting better at eating healthy understanding what foods are good for us and what foods are bad for us and why but the point being is that as a species in the last hundred years we solved calorie problems pretty much permanently we produce enough calories as a species that nobody has to go hungry the problem now is distribution and allocation which we will talk about closer to the end of the video um which AI could probably help with finally science and medicine in particular have removed certain constraints or bottlenecks so for instance I already mentioned that our immune systems are stronger than they were before and that's partially due to Medicine though vaccinations we can artificially make our well it's it's not I don't say artificially that's not the right word but we can make our immune system stronger through these controlled exposures uh which means that we are now more resilient and we didn't have to use Evolution to do that that being said it's going to be really difficult because modern medicine is also like 100 years old it's going to be really difficult to figure out how modern medicine is going to impact evolution in the long run and AI is just going to turn that up to 11. um yes so Alpha fold and crispr uh basically if you if you're not familiar Alpha fold allows us to predict the Str the shape and structure of proteins how they how it folds this is a really difficult problem because you're basically simulating gigantic molecules with a lot of really complex internal interactions and it's super mathematically intensive Alpha fold tool Alpha fold 2 basically solves this problem it's not perfect but Alpha fold 3 and other Technologies they're gonna solve that perfectly so what this does is it allows us to figure out why certain genes or genetic combinations result in result in diseases now you might say oh well between Alpha fold and crispr we're going to cure all genetic disease it's only a few years away it's not that easy unfortunately so one reason is that there there are very few bad genes there are a few genes and and copy errors and and genetic variants that are just known to guarantee a disease but most diseases are not single genes uh so for instance with autism more than 200 genes and then all of their variants are associated with the predilection for it and so genes are not really deterministic except in a few small cases so there's a lot of really complex interactions because it's not just genes right the the metabolic pathways in the body which is an emergent aspect of being a complex organism genes is just like the foundation right if you were an analogize genes to like the architecture of a building the genes is just like the concrete foundation then you still have the rest of the building you got all the plumbing you got all the wiring you've got the you know all the other systems that go into it so you need the foundation but that's not all you need you need a lot more than that so that all said okay if it's if it's super complicated how are these AI Technologies going to impact Evolution well like I just said a minute ago medicine is huge and it's it's really difficult to figure out how that's going to impact evolution in the long run but right off the right off the cuff what it looks like uh genetic medicine and AI is going to do is allow us to cure things like cancer Alzheimer's diabetes and other stuff so imagine that we get rid of all known diseases um and then so that I mean that that alone will will change a lot for us then aging and Longevity I think that this is going to Far and Away have the biggest impact on Evolution and so what I mean by that is if we can stop aging if we all get to the point where we have an indefinitely long lifespan which I predict is going to happen certainly within my lifetime does that mean that Evolution stops that is probably worth a lot of discussion on its own because what happens if through medicine and AI we cure all causes of diseases right what if we what if we get rid of Aging we can we have Rejuvenation therapies and suddenly we don't even need to have children that often because we live forever that could be a huge impact on Evolution so I'm not saying that I predict that but I'm just pointing out the possibility that like it is hypothetically conceivably within the realm of possibilities that if 8 billion people alive today all stop dying maybe Evolution stops too now on that cheery note uh one of the biggest questions that people ask is are is AI going to make us smarter or Dumber so there's the there's the sociological phenomenon aspect which is you know education and so on but then how does that interact with evolution so first let's just look at how AI might impact uh education so given every opportunity I will smash that Star Trek button so this scene came from Star Trek Voyager where uh Naomi Wildman who was born on the ship she is often used to explore uh like what what uh education and what childhood might be like in the future and one of the things that she does is she goes to the Holodeck to learn and so she learns from these basically video game characters what the Holodeck is basically just virtual reality so she is constantly exploring and learning at a level that is optimized for her and so she is like she's supposed to be like eight years old and already knows calculus so one thing that I see as a possibility is that AI could help create highly personalized education experiences in an incredibly Rich learning environments um that allow all children to reach to to get closer to their maximum uh natural potential uh so that's one thing so keep that in mind another thing that AI has the possibility of doing is improving access to information and education globally so for instance chat GPT is much much cheaper than a high quality tutor and even though it's not quite as good it's still a whole lot better than nothing um and then finally maybe these AI tutors and AI tools could be designed to challenge you to challenge your ways of thinking and so for those of you familiar with my open source project Raven one of the core objective functions of this AI machine is I call it an ace an autonomous cognitive entity one of the core objective functions is to increase understanding and that is one of the points of that objective function is to challenge your way of thinking and make sure that you understand and believe or or the that you understand the things that you believe and to challenge those beliefs so that you can raise your level of understanding so I think that AI will allow us to create entity and tutors that'll actually keep us honest it might not be deployed that way but I think we could now that being said there are absolutely some potential problems with AI and education and information so one is over Reliance just do it for me right uh you know I I if if we do succeed in creating autonomous cognitive entities they might take over the Lion's Share of our cognitive labor which means that we're just going to be like I'm not going to challenge myself it's too hard another possibility is Echo Chambers and Bubbles that's already a problem but imagine that you have an AI companion that is designed to only cater to your ego and never challenge you then your Echo chamber gets out of the internet and into your daily life so that could be a big problem now that being said I still predict that we're going to have a huge net gain in terms of our intellectual capabilities especially from a global perspective because you look at the fact that uh globally we will we will write we will raise the floor we will raise the minimum threshold of education and increase the amount of information that everyone has access to and if we become smarter as a planet as a species that will absolutely impact Evolution really difficult to figure out how but it could be woven into some of this stuff and we'll unpack some of this in the recap at the end finally or not finally but next post-scarcity economics no matter what happens AI is going to impact jobs and economics will there be more jobs or less personally I think less I think that we will have 70 unemployment by 2030 even if I'm wrong AI is still going to change work and how we relate to work so if I'm right and we and we start getting super high levels of unemployment we will need to move to a redistribution or allocation model and what that means is basically a robot tax if companies or individuals or governments or whoever produce value with robots they'll probably be taxed at a higher rate so that that value can be redistributed to everyone else AI can help with those allocation of resources so I mentioned food earlier we already produce enough food to feed everyone the problem is distribution and allocation maybe AI can help solve hunger permanently maybe AI can help solve housing permanently because also we have enough housing units for everyone the problem is allocation uh and then when you when you start thinking about all these things that AI could possibly help with you think the overall quality of life for everyone could go up and I mean everyone like not just Americans not just Europeans globally quality of life could go up globally so if that happens what else might change well number one our priorities and values are going to have to change right now we are hyper individualistic we are hyper competitive and we are we have crab mentality so one of the things that I do is I always plug this is post nihilism I suspect that we will have to change our identity as a species away from career away from work and towards valuing life more intrinsically and so that's what I call Post nihilism another thing that might change is fertility rates uh the question becomes do fertility rates go up or down because here's the here's the thing if suddenly you don't need to work to make ends meet you are free to choose what you want to do imagine if you like Suddenly It's like oh you get the equivalent of of fifteen thousand dollars every month just by virtue of existing right that's a pretty intoxicating idea if you want children you absolutely could afford it then but you might choose not to because it's like eh what's what's the rush right especially if we have uh much longer life spans if you know that you're probably going to live 500 years 5 000 years what's the rush so Evolution might slow down or it might speed up one thing that I think that very well could happen and we'll talk about this in a actually no I'll put this off in terms of uh reproduction rate I've got a slide for that so what happens if we don't work what happens if we uh are given the freedom to self-determine we'll spend more time in nature we'll spend more time playing and more time with friends and family now some of you might know I recently quit my day job and so from personal experience I will say it is not that hard to adapt and change your identity and say you know what I actually don't identify with my career anymore in fact looking back I didn't identify with my career for oh say 75 of my career it was just a job what I really identify with is what I'm doing right now I identify with AI and communication and teaching people and helping the world I happen to get rewarded for it but I started doing this long before I got rewarded for it we love and and and I when I say we I mean humans we love challenges and interesting experiences that's why like video games are so popular is because it is a carefully curated challenging experience that's not going to change whether or not we have ai for jobs or not that it is in our nature to love challenges and experiences so what AI might do is unlock us to have even more interesting challenges and even more interesting experiences how will that shape Evolution difficult to say but it almost certainly will Ai and dating so we talked about sexual selection uh earlier in the video mate selection is deliberately or accidentally choosing partners that concentrate characteristics so what are you selecting for right um what and what I mean by that an example is selecting for intellect or proxies of intellect so if you have a graduate degree you are something like four times more likely to marry someone and by extension of children with someone else who also has a graduate degree now I'm not saying that there's a gene for you know getting a PhD however like any other complex Behavior there are going to be at least a handful of genes that enable that behavior or support that behavior so for instance um you know people that get they get Doctorate Degrees they're more likely to be uh good at reading and good at thinking abstractly and so on and so forth so if there are genes that are associated with some of those cognitive abilities and behaviors then they're going to concentrate in people with graduate degrees uh conversely we also select for physical attractiveness socioeconomic status and again a lot of these are emergent uh characteristics I'm not saying that there's a gene for Rich there's not a gene for fit but there are many many genes and genetic combinations that speak to those emergent characteristics and they tend to get concentrated I think the term for this is stratification I don't remember anyways there is there is a term for that where it's like well genetic drift right it's it's a kind of form of internal competition that can result in genetic drift so animal husbandry is what we have done for many thousands of years which is deliberately selecting animals and breeding those animals together to get the traits that we want that's how we have such like chubby chickens that produce so much meat it's how we have like big beefy cows it's how we have super powerful um cereal crops then of course we add in genetic engineering into that and we can we can accelerate that even further but animal husbandry and and breeding programs are already a form of genetic engineering so what about human husbandry and I don't mean like you know uh uh arranged marriages and stuff although arranged marriages do happen but what I mean is what if we deliberately select People based on genetics there's already uh genetic matching dating services out there as AI advances and other Technologies like genetic sequencing and other stuff happens it is entirely possible that we will soon have the ability to like go to a genetic counselor and and get you know like give a drop of blood for for both parents um so like you could go to a genetic counselor so this was explored in Gattaca and a few other movies uh but basically you can select a partner based on genetic match if you want to have children but you could also select uh egg and sperm donors or surrogates or whatever based on either selecting four positive traits or selecting against undesirable traits so for instance one of the things that they already do and I don't know if this is still true but someone told me this once let me know in the comments if it is true but like if you want to be a sperm donor like you have to have you have to be over six feet tall and you have to have a graduate degree or something like that and it's just like oh so you're you've already decided like these are positive characteristics that you want to select for I don't know if it's true it might maybe it was true and it's no longer true I don't know anyways point being is that you can look for these emergent qualities and select for them family history that sort of stuff but AI could help accelerate that it may or may not have any impact there something that I think will have a lot more direct impact on Family Planning which by extension will impact evolution is going to be AI therapy and AI companions so AI therapy is going to help result in healthier people better relationships and therefore will impact families so people that may not have had children very well could end up having children by virtue of having been had mate selection you know dating helped with AI they become healthier people they connect with better people they you know go out into the wild they find each other and they say let's start a family so you could have a lot of knock-on effects that AI does to help modify or influence sexual selection this was in the movie her so the conclusion of the movie her was that the AI all decided collectively we need to remove ourselves and help humans reconnect with each other because that's what's going to be best for the species it's entirely possible that that's going to happen naturally uh and then finally AI companions so if you look out there there's lots of people like replica is the number one uh like sexy chat bot or whatever so you know cat girl robot girlfriends instead of real people this might cause some people to drop out of the procreation race altogether there are certainly people on the internet that are like oh I would much rather date a robot than a real person um and actually I was corrected on this from a previous video where I assumed that it was predominantly men but uh plenty of people pointed out that there's lots of women that are in the same camp so what if AI helps some people just drop out of sexual selection altogether some people do already uh there was a genetic survey that I read many years ago that came to the conclusion that only 30 percent of men contribute to um uh subsequent Generations contribute genetic material to subsequent Generations so already even before AI 70 of men never have children and that is not true of women the vast majority of women do have children um so there's a lot of uh this is called sexual antagonism which is uh evolutionary pressure between the genders between the Sexes of a species um but what I'm thinking is that for those that want family that want children AI is going to help facilitate that and accelerate that and for those that don't it's going to allow them to check out of uh the procreation pool altogether so what that might do is that maybe 500 years from now a thousand years from now 50 000 years from now we will have been selecting for people that want children so it might it might become embedded in our nature that just by virtue of those who pass on their genes are people that want children are going to be people that are more family oriented um and whatever genes contribute to that sense of connection that sense of belonging and the desire for children could be magnified This is highly speculative but this is one thing that um that I have uh I actually predict in my novel that I'm working on um is that in the future if we if we go this route it could be that everyone you know because up until now uh procreation has largely been like socially driven like you're required to carry on the line of your family but my generation and younger they're like heck with that idea uh-uh not doing that so then by virtue the people who want children are the ones anyways you get the idea all right so finally the ethics and ramifications of all this playing God who has the right to decide what is good and what should be selected for who has the right to guide or steer our Evolution well one thing that I want to point out is that the rich and the Reckless have been doing this anyways the people with more privilege have always tried to to stack things in their favor right whether it's um you know rich men look for trophy wives and or whatever people will always try and do the best and so many people whether it's deliberate and conscious right like oh I want to have the best children because having good children whether it's a good genetic pedigree or whatever is a point of Pride for a lot of people um and so then we've been doing this for centuries AI is just going to support that right whether it's through genetic technology or match genetic matchmaking or AI tutors whatever it's going to be the same story just you know with a new shiny uh technology so I don't think that's going to really change anything um now one thing that could be bad is unintended consequences because what if we decide to um you know add a new Gene to our children and it turns out that that gene causes immense suffering or random diseases later on that could be really bad so there's a very strong argument for just letting nature run its course that being said we don't really let nature run its course anyways we have vaccines we have antibiotics we um there's we already do genetic screening on embryos um and so like if if your embryo if your fetus or embryo has certain genetic abnormalities it might be recommended that you have an abortion so we're already using some of this technology to at least select against known problems um we don't necessarily select four things but we certainly select against things so we don't really let nature run its course already but it remains to be seen of how AI might influence that further uh but as I mentioned inequality privilege and access are likely to be the biggest ethical questions so and the number one question there is will it be expensive I actually suspect that Ai and and all the downstream technologies that like you know AI influence medicine AI influence genetics um all of this stuff is actually going to be really cheap and really Universal so remember post scarcity economics post-scares theme economics means that everything that you need is essentially free or so cheap that it doesn't really matter and that could extend to like mRNA vaccines right we just had a global event that that caused us to produce literally I think hundreds of billions or tens of billions of mRNA vaccines in a few months right or or a year or so what happens when a a vaccine for all cancer for all diabetes comes out just the economic benefit of vaccinating everyone against cancer and diabetes and Alzheimer's and high cholesterol and heart disease and all that stuff just the economic benefit would be great right and then if it's as cheap as an mRNA vaccine cost 60 bucks six dollars whatever I think that a lot of this stuff is going to be so cheap that it's just going to be brain dead simple that everyone should get it or at least everyone should be given the uh the option I am a big believer in consent so I personally suspect that that privilege is going to be less of an issue than people fear certainly the rich are going to have access to it sooner um while it's still expensive so because like you know uh 15 years ago genetic sequencing was still like thirty thousand dollars a shot and it wasn't that particularly valuable but then only the rich could afford it and now it's what three hundred dollars a shot it's almost getting to the point where like anyone can afford to have their genes sequenced um and so over time because of the because one because of AI and two because of the incentives to make this stuff cheaper I think that it's going to be universally accessible within a reasonable period of time all right so in conclusion here are some key takeaways and predictions first remember that tools and Technology have already had huge impacts on our Evolution for literally millions of years AI is just another tool um just like how tractors and planes just another tool just another technology personally I think that genetic Tech through and AI with medicine is going to have the biggest direct impact on Evolution through curing disease and increasing longevity I honestly think that human evolution might really slow down in some respects that natural human evolution might slow down a lot due to genetic medicine and Longevity that being said if we can run simulations and and genetically engineer our children our children might be more different than you know like 10 Generations um in the past so we might we we might be the first species to take full control over our Evolution and that can be done through mate selection it can be done through genetic um uh simulations uh Alpha fold like imagine that you can just run all of your child's genes through Alpha fold probably six and it'll say okay it you know your child's metabolism is going to have this this and this and they're going to have these these characteristics so on and so forth so that will probably have the largest direct impact um so it's kind of like Evolution will slow down in some ways speed up in others um education and intelligence AI is definitely going to have a huge impact on our intelligence as a species which will probably have a pretty dramatic impact on Evolution although that's going to be a much more diffuse impact and it'll happen over the long run but imagine that like 2000 years from now everyone has an IQ equivalent of like 180 or 200 right imagine that everyone born 2000 years from now is five standard deviations higher IQ than everyone alive today and so then it's like um I don't think it's going to be the way that Neil deGrasse Tyson said that like it's not like we're going to learn calculus by age three I think I think that the way that that'll play out is that we actually learn for longer periods of time now that's going to suck for some people that hate school because imagine being in school for 80 years but when you have that much to learn and that much capacity it might take long longer but your capacity to learn might be much much higher not really sure how that's going to happen it could also be faster post-scarcity economics will drastically alter our identity and priorities which again might change our relationship to the idea of evolution and Family Planning and Family Planning under all this context will be very different and this comes down to sexual selection which is who do you have children with how many children do you have when why so on and so forth so basically Evolution the the long and short of it evolution is going to be impacted in countless small Ways by Ai and probably a few really big ways so I hope you found this interesting and
