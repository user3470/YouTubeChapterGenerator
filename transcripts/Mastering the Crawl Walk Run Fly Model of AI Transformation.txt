hello everybody David Shapiro here with another video so today's video we're going to talk about the crawl walk run fly model of Enterprise transformation in the age of the fourth Industrial Revolution now the fourth Industrial Revolution is primarily driven by artificial intelligence but also internet saturation you might have heard of spatial web or web 3.0 but really artificial intelligence is kind of front and center and it's certainly what's kicking it off into high gear before we get into the video I just wanted to do a quick plug for my patreon uh it's patreon.com daveshapp all tiers get access to the private Discord server where we talk about Ai and being neurospicy and a number of other topics but also the higher tiers get access to one-on-one conversations and consultations all of my work is ad-free and open source and so this is part of a new social contract basically my goal is to reduce friction as much as possible by making information as easy to access as possible and that's why I committed all to the public domain it's all public good cut out the middleman no advertisers nothing like that but the exchange is that you people support me which that's why I'm able to do what I do so incentivize the behavior you want to see and with that let's get back to the show first let's talk about industrial revolutions when I say fourth Industrial Revolution that implies that there are three before this so the first Industrial Revolution was about Steam and steel this is where we first saw uh factories and urbanization really picking up uh there were new tools uh new sources of energy namely coal and some petroleum and the this uh switched from manual labor to machine-based labor so this is where we saw a really big uptick in the use of things like looms and Cotton Gins and all that sort of stuff so as we got better at making making steel and using steam we had access to new sources of energy the Second Industrial Revolution was more about electricity and mechanization so this is where we saw the introduction of industrialized agriculture mechanized Warfare and then also assembly lines so this is early late late 19th century and early 20th century the first Revolution sorry I should have said this earlier uh started in the 18th and 19th centuries and then finally the third Revolution was computers and internet so this is the digital age this is the transition from analog to digital uh which you know basically from from snail mail to email and this also saw a pivot from uh manual labor based economies to knowledge based or service-based economies this was a huge pivot because uh as we got more and more people out of factories and out of fields and had machines doing more of that then it became a knowledge-based economy and finally the fourth Industrial Revolution is as I mentioned primarily about artificial intelligence uh to a lesser extent about internet saturation but again we've already had internet but we're getting uh more and more saturation of Internet with things like spatial web and web 3.0 and so that's where we are today we're really at the launch point of the fourth Industrial Revolution which is going to have huge impacts for all Enterprises across the world so the Mantra that I always uh iterate is better faster cheaper this is why we use technology we use uh tractors and Oracle databases because they are better faster and cheaper than the alternative tractors are better faster and cheaper than doing it by hand or with Ox Oracle databases are better faster and cheaper than having rooms full of filing cabinets this is why we use technology now technology adds complexity and also there are new relationships new interactions because of Technology with Oracle databases for instance you need data centers and server admins and infrastructure and dbas you need a whole bunch of other jobs that didn't exist before whereas before if you had filing cabinets you had office staff back back office staff so this creates a need for more specialized jobs and that sort of thing now this is where we might see a reversal a change in that Trend so rather than having more specialized jobs it's entirely possible that as AI gets more advanced we're going to see a reduction of the need for human labor and I'll walk you through this life cycle in just a moment but basically if AI has the ability to outperform humans if AI becomes better and faster and cheaper than human labor we won't hire humans it's that simple that's that's the way that the economy works that's the way that neoliberalism works that's the way that the free market works is that it is constantly looking for efficiencies and if it is more efficient to use machines instead of humans that's what we're going to do and that's what we have done for the past two or three centuries is every time we have an opportunity to replace human labor with machine labor we take that opportunity this is not going to be any different the question is what kinds of human labor can we replace in the past it was manual labor now we're replacing intellectual labor which is the biggest difference between previous industrial revolutions and the fourth Industrial Revolution uh and so the the primary signal that you need to pay attention to is better faster cheaper those are the three uh paradigms or components of efficiency and so as artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated more powerful more useful there are going to be there there's going to be transition points where suddenly these software applications these these new kinds of machines are more efficient than humans and that's when you need to make the transition for whatever that job task is from Human to machine labor okay so if you're watching this video you're probably a business leader uh director board member whatever if you're watching this video here are some questions and challenges that you might have uh which brought you here how do Enterprise acclimate to the fourth Industrial Revolution what is it going to change for us how do we navigate this seismic shift uh what do I need to pay attention to what are the main strategies what do I tell my board of directors this is actually a question that uh some of my clients have told me is that some of my content has really helped them talk to their boards uh in order to tell them how are we going to navigate the fourth Industrial Revolution and artificial intelligence how do I set the tone for my company what are the biggest threats and opportunities here and finally and perhaps most importantly how do we avoid getting left behind so now we're going to Pivot and talk about the crawl walk run fly model the fourth Industrial Revolution or the singularity or whatever you want to call it this is a tidal wave it is an Unstoppable force and you can't ignore it and if you do ignore it you're going to get wiped out by it it's that simple a lot of stuff is going to change uh you know whether in the economy the whatever sector you're in and if you don't adapt if you don't surf the wave you're just going to get washed away so how do you adapt this is where I introduce the crawl walk run fly model with the the so this is a this is a staged approach that can take you from Zero to Hero uh to use an old platitude uh in terms of adapting to this new trend so you start with the crawl which is you adapt or sorry adopt individual tools uh individual AI tools that help you save time energy money and brain power so these tactical tools are just one-off things that that give you just a little bit of an advantage make your employees just a little bit more effective the walk phase is where you start to Cluster these tools together into tool chains and toolboxes and so this is where you have multiple AI tools that are presented in the same user interface or in the same workspace that allows you to get those compounding returns and those synergistic uh or those synergies in order to get multiple AI tools working together to really accelerate uh business processes the Run phase is where you start to automate this you create new assembly lines based on these clusters of AI tools and so this Harkens back to the third Industrial Revolution or sorry the Second Industrial Revolution with Henry Ford and the assembly line and the mass production of the Model T so instead now we're aiming for mass production of intellectual labor mass production of data goods and services and then finally the fly model is where you fully remove humans from the picture all together with autonomous agents and polymorphic platforms and so this is the direction that it's going it is it is all of these things are hypothetically possible today and people are trying to build them and so I've just written or read uh the writing on the wall and this is the direction it's going and so what you can do is you can adopt this strategy to get from here where you're not using any AI today or using very little and ultimately getting to the point where a majority of your business is fully automated so how do we get there so starting with the crawl phase individual tools so these are individual AI based tools that save time energy money and brain power human brain power is the scarcityst resource in a knowledge-based economy and so really what you need to do is focus on AI tools that reduce the cognitive load and decision fatigue of your employees because again your employee's brain power that is the scarcest resource most humans have maybe two hours of cognitive labor in them per day before we just get too tired and so the more that you can perform cognitive offload with individual tools whether they're built in-house or bought from vendors you don't necessarily need to build all this stuff in-house this is going to be how you how you kick it off and this is there's a few other components of the crawl phase mostly getting familiar building an intuition for these tools low stakes pilot tests and that sort of thing is going to really kind of uh Grease the wheels let's say so that your organization can start to adapt more AI tools further on down the road and what you're going to be looking for is reduction in time cost and I don't mean some you know 10 Improvement I mean 10x Improvement because there are some AI tools out there that already uh really greatly improve and accelerate things so an example is case text so case text is a tool that lawyers use that does a lot of legal research and it can it can literally do days or weeks worth of legal research in minutes and so there we're looking at a reduction of time cost by a 100x or a thousand X and that's just one tool so what we need to be looking for is all of these AI tools that save you 5x 10x 100x or 1000x on time energy money and brain power and so these drastically reduce the cost and time of some business processes and as you accumulate more and more tools that become indispensable you're going to build up more tribal knowledge you're going to have more principles and disciplines and best practices that you have internally and then also you're going to want to support cross-pollination because what happens is a lot of especially larger organizations you end up with these naturally occurring silos where people just don't talk to each other in the era of the fourth Industrial Revolution in AI you need to deliberately create cross-pollination channels whether that's hackathons or corporate events or otherwise you need to make those channels so that people share these tools otherwise you're going to end up with one Department that's way out ahead and other departments getting left behind you're going to need to deliberately create knowledge sharing because again building up that tribal knowledge and best practices that is the name of the game um as you're either developing or adopting these individual AI tools the walk phase is where you start to really accumulate these tools into tool chains and toolboxes so these are clusters of tools that work together really well and either you can if you have the ability to bring them together into a single user experience or user interface that's great or if your vendors have the ability to do that this is the way that things are going where instead of just having one tool you have a bunch of tools to perform work on your work product whether it's you know a legal filing or uh you know some of my clients they deal with Regulatory Compliance and so they need to have you know lawsuits or or filings with regulatory bodies uh or in in the case of if you're a fiction writer like I am I have a collection of AI tools that I use to um you know either brainstorm or provide feedback and so by creating these collections of tools and putting them together in one place you start to create uh like a a workspace or a workbench that uses these AI tools and so then the takeaway here is you start to you start to pay attention to the end-to-end process where are the inputs and outputs of various business work products and what I mean by work product is are you paying bills are you filing taxes right there's all kinds of business things that it they're all information and data based and I don't mean database like SQL I mean they're they're data oriented work products and so by focusing on the end-to-end process what are the inputs outputs and Transformations that they go through you can start to build those workflows and then you're starting to build uh the beginnings of the assembly line where you have stations uh that have those clusters of tools and work product move seamlessly from one station to the next and so this is the Run phase the assembly lines and so how does assembly lines how are these Modified by artificial intelligence in this case you have automatic routing automatic resource allocation and you start to reduce human involvement so again it's about paying attention to the flow of work products from input to the Transformations that happen to it as well as the outputs so when I say resource allocation what I mean is is there something that a human needs to sign off on is there external information that you need access to or Are there specific Transformations that need to happen to that information in order for it to be useful or valuable for the output so for instance uh in the in the financial department there's a tremendous number of Transformations that happen to the information that they need whether it's just raw receipts and bills they take all that they transform that information into something that's more useful to gain insights from it to tell stories about it and ultimately that is used to you know pay the bills to pay your employees to pay taxes that sort of stuff uh one another big part of the assembly lines is to continue to reduce decision fatigue and overall reducing human involvement and so part of this one of the biggest Gates here is odd using AI for the checks for the oversight and for the monitoring so in the previous stage in the tool chains and toolboxes you still have humans doing most of the work they're just using AI tools to do their work faster in the assembly line phase this is where you start to have the machines doing more of the work for the humans and you have the humans providing oversight and guidance to ensure that things don't go off the rails but the one of the key takeaways here is that you're constantly streamlining and optimizing the workflows and processes and you're also creating more layers of abstraction and so what I mean by that is you've got the you've got the individual tools doing the work on you know the business processes but then you also have a layer above that that is monitoring and watching and doing quality control and like I said at first you're going to have humans doing most of the quality control but uh what you should be doing is then using the AI to do as much of the quality control monitoring and routing as possible and that is once you develop that discipline where you have the workflows that are fully automated that is where you get to the autonomous agents and polymorphic platforms that is kind of the end goal here and what I mean by that is workflows that make workflows workflows that modify applications workflows that are mission oriented and Mission driven and are fully instrumented and use the Telemetry to make decisions about how to change themselves or change each other and so this sounds like a really huge step but once you have fully automated assembly lines across your organization for every Department that includes it that includes software that includes finance that includes HR then everything is operationalized and everything is automated and so then you can take those same uh principles that you've learned over time and and create this flywheel right this flywheel effect of self-improvement of uh of continuously removing humans from the loop because again the biggest constraint that we're going to see here in this age of post-labor Economics is removing the human bottleneck from business and that sounds that might sounds like really dystopian to some people because again what I'm what I'm literally talking about is a road map to get humans out of the labor force altogether or as much as possible now we will need to renegotiate the social contract between businesses people and government but that's a topic for another video what I'm talking about here is how do we get businesses to the point where they are making the most possible use of artificial intelligence and that is removing human bottlenecks as much as possible with principle-driven Mission oriented and self-directed polymorphic applications and autonomous agents so that is the gold standard one thing that I've noticed out there in the industry is that a lot of people are trying to put the cart before the horse which is actually why I decided to make this video is because a lot of people see that autonomous agents are possible and they're trying to go straight there and particularly for Enterprise organizations it's going to be really difficult to go to jump straight to the end of the line with a fully autonomous agents sure you can do it in in smaller areas uh you know with one-off tools here and there but really particularly for the large Enterprises you're going to need to go through a transformational phase which means building up that familiarity building up that intuition building the tools that build the tools building the tools that automate the assembly lines and then building the Watchers and then the Watchers that watch the Watchers that sort of thing uh now what's going to happen to your organization I made another video that was a generative AI for CEOs where I kind of talk about maintaining those principles and paying attention to the fact that there probably will be layoffs um now I don't know what the net effect is going to be personally I anticipate that most human jobs are going away for good particularly in the knowledge sector so there's a a trend that I like to use and that is 200 years ago 95 of us were farmers uh now only two percent of us are farmers and so those jobs were ultimately replaced by new kinds of jobs I don't know if that's going to happen but this is a characteristic of all industrial revolutions which is that the composition of the labor force changes drastically and I think that that's going to happen again again I don't know what the net effect is personally I think that we're going to lose most jobs but time will tell but the purpose of this video is how do businesses get from here to ahead of the curve on the fourth Industrial Revolution so thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this reach out to me on LinkedIn or patreon if you'd like to talk about it either podcast consult consultation or whatever thanks have a good one
