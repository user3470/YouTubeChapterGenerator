hey everyone David Shapiro here with a video today's video is going to cover the concept of one salience and two anticipating user needs before the user knows what they need um but before we dive in I've got a couple of announcements to make so one um there is a subreddit that I and a couple other folks that are experts on artificial cognition or an autonomous cognitive entities have created it's R artificial sentience so if you want to start uh having conversations and jump in uh please feel free to do so it's public uh beginners are welcome um basically now that the concepts of cognitive architectures and autonomous cognitive entities are taking off I'm taking my hands off the steering wheel right I've done my part I've popularized the idea I'm starting the conversation and now it's time for everyone to get involved so this is our subreddit artificial sentience um a quick update on Raven um which is my artificial cognitive entity project um we have moved to the um to the third stage of creating um consensus so we're drafting proposals um so I we we listed um you know the decision criteria I made a proposal we're getting feedback on it another person made a proposal and we'll start working on doing feedback so we're workshopping the consensus mechanism and again uh creating autonomous machines that can think and decide on their own the stakes are way too high for it to be done completely behind closed doors um and so that's why we're doing this and the first thing that you need to do with any project is decide how the governance is going to be now um really big update for me personally I have decided to leave um my startup so I'm going to take the rest of 2023 off I'm not going to do any startups no full-time jobs nothing I am going to focus on uh primarily finishing my novel which includes amongst other things Ai and then uh other AI stuff you know YouTube patreon that sort of thing um so this is my full-time thing so because of that I really need to ask for y'all's help with support on patreon so I'm doing this full time I'm organizing meetups I'm organizing online communities so on and so forth and uh so yeah every little bit helps the average supporter I think is about 15 a month so most people are somewhere between the 10 and 20 a month support but every little bit helps I've got over 20 000 subscribers and less than 400 supporters on patreon so some of y'all could jump over onto patreon that would be a really big help and then furthermore if you want some one-on-one help either via chat email and I try and avoid Zoom just because Zoom fatigue is real um that being said sometimes a conversation is necessary if you sign up for a higher tier I'm happy to jump on a call with you and your team in fact I've got a couple calls later today um anyways so with all that out of the way I'm working on this concept of salience so here's the repo chat GPT underscore API underscore salience so this is a concept from neuroscience and it is it is one of the primary attention mechanisms that happens in our brains and if you look this up you're probably not going to find anything in in like the Neuroscience literature this is an emergent property that I've noticed from having read a whole bunch of neuroscience and psychology and so basically what happens is as you're having a conversation or listening or working on something your brain is forming like a basically a Knowledge Graph around the most Salient points of what you're working on so say for instance I'm uh working on a chat bot so the most Salient thing that I'm working on is what is the goal that I have here and what is the um what what am I currently working on are the problems that I'm facing so salience is um in in humans there's a few there's a few things there's tasks aliens so tasks alien says okay what information is most relevant to the task that I'm doing there's also emotional salience or emotional content so this is this our memories are organized primarily around emotional valence and surveillance is the energy level and then disposition is the direction or the kind of emotion is it positive or negative um and so emotional salience is is how we uh prioritize memories which is why you remember stressful events more than just ordinary daily events because your emotions are a heuristic that allows your brain to say oh this was important because we were scared this is important because we were angry or whatever now tasks aliens is more about cognitive control and cognitive control is Task selection which is which task do I do I choose to do and then task switching which is when you need to change tasks so cognitive control is one of the primary things that we need to figure out in order to have autonomous cognitive entities or cognitive architectures and salience and this is why I'm doing a video an entire video about salience is how we do that so you guys have probably seen the Wolfram Alpha video right where there it has task selection using I think Lang chain where it says okay given this array of tools that I have how do I which tool do I choose right and there's also papers out there about how um large language models can actually learn to use apis on the Fly which is really cool so they're learning on the Fly they can do task selection but then how do you how do you do task switching how do you know what to focus on and that is the concept of salience so I tried Visual Studio code and I hate it I keep telling y'all I hate Ides I also tried GitHub Code Pilot and I hate it too because it's really dumb it has no idea what I'm doing because the stuff that I'm working on is like so novel and so it keeps suggesting stuff that's not really relevant and it's not really picking up what I'm putting down so I'm going to switch off of visual studio and I'm just going to go back to notepad plus plus I know you guys think I'm completely crazy but you know what it works for me and anyways so here's what we've got this is a really simple script that will serve as a chat bot and will demonstrate the concept of salience so I'm also switching over to the chat GPT API so if you come over here here's the here's the documentation the endpoint you call it super simple there's only two things to know about it one is the model GPT 3.5 turbo and um they have this little note here that says the the turbo 0301 so that's the March 1st version doesn't pay much attention to system and it looks like they they are going to do that so open AI what you might consider doing is adding a lever here where we we get we put a weight so that we can call like the temperature or whatever I don't know if it's possible depending on how you're fine-tuning it but if you have like you know how how much do you want to pay attention to the system uh role you know anyways so there's a model which I'm going to stick with the GPT 3.5 turbo because I want it to really pay attention to the system and then then you have a messages payload which is a list of dictionaries and there's three kinds of roles there's the system role there's the user and then there's the assistant so it's nice and clean very straightforward so that's what we're working on and then the last thing I have to show you before we get started is the two prompts that one try and anticipate the user needs ahead of time and two assess the salience so they're pretty straightforward first is given the following chat log this is the anticipation prompt infer the user's actual information needs attempts to anticipate what the user truly needs even if the user does not fully understand it yet themselves and let's change this um or is asking um the wrong questions so a lot of people that I have talked to have observed particularly chat GPT is really good at taking just a few data points and inferring what you actually need and so what we can do is if we have the model if we actually explicitly tell the model figure out what the user needs there was another paper that showed that large language models like gpt3 already have theory of mind the paper said that the theory of mine seems to have been an emergent property given the number of parameters and the amount of training data so if we just tell it anticipate what the user needs figure out what's going on in the user's head it can do that um more often than not it's not always going to be 100 accurate but just wait and see you'll see how crazy um how crazy prescient it is and then finally um salience so given the following chat log Write a brief sailor brief summary of only the most Salient points of the conversation so rather than summarizing the entire thing we're going to allow the language model to use its intelligence to say this is this is the bit that we that we carry about um so we'll do this uh and and there you there you have it so the other the the chat script itself is super straightforward it just takes the user input then we'll feed the conversation into the anticipation and salience and then we'll update the system variable um and so then I've got all the logs saved out to here so I've already got a conversation going so um let me bring you up to speed and said hey I need your um I need your help planning out my day and so then uh behind the scenes it says the user likely needs help with time management and organization so they may need help with prioritizing tasks setting goals and creating a schedule so in this case you can see that just just by this input it anticipated okay this is what I think you need um and then it added the evaluation so I modified the prompt to get rid of that but it's really interesting the the user's actual information needs are not directly related to the ai's goals but the AI can still provide assistance the AI can provide resources and advice to help the user plan out their day so again super relevant I want to figure out some prompt engineering to get that or maybe break it down into parallel anyways salience the user is looking for help planning out their day and they are interacting with an AI named Raven which has three goals reduced suffering increased prosperity and increase understanding so again if you have a fully autonomous machine part of autonomy or agency is that you have your own goals now that being said we don't want the AI to be able to create all of its goals from scratch with in a total vacuum we want it to have some intrinsic goals and so these intrinsic goals are the core objective functions reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding are the universal guard rails that will keep the chat Bots honest and benevolent so then finally the output hi there I'd be happy to help you plan your day what do you have planned so far so do you see how the tone of this is very different from normal chat GPT um it's very clear that it understands like oh hey I'm having a conversation and I said nothing I need your help and it says okay the uh I updated the prompt and it said the user likely needs help with time management they may need help prioritizing tasks setting goals creating a schedule breaking down tasks into smaller more manageable chunks creating a timeline additionally they may need to help identifying and utilizing resources salience the user is looking for out planning their day and interacting with Raven the AI can provide resources and so then finally Raven's output so I have this as debug right this would be hidden and what I wanted to do is show that I'm not the only one working on this this is what Bing does behind the scene so I ask being how does a chatbot work and it says how does a chat bot work and then there's a few other things it has like internal monologue I'm not going to try and jailbreak it because like if you want to see people jailbreaking chat GPT and Bing go for horrifying I'm telling you how to actually build it yourself um why because I wrote the book on it literally anyways um okay Raven sure we can start by breaking your down your day down into different tasks or activities first what are some tasks that you need to accomplish today so do you see how um all of these ideas are kind of transmuted into the into a very conversational output first what are some tasks are there any important deadlines or appointments you need to keep I'll say yes whoops um darn it hang on my keyboard's a little off center that's why I'm typing wonky there we go okay um yes um I have a meeting with a patreon supporter and that's it I'm also pretty tired because I've been working hard okay so rather than like you've probably seen me do other videos where interacting with Chad GPT you have to be really specific about what you want and give it guard rails but I'm asking it to do that for me um wow okay okay great let's prioritize the meeting with the patreon since that speed seems to be the most important task to ensure you are well rested for the meeting let's plan on some rest for your schedule okay wake up shower breakfast work on important project that requires Focus oh wow this is actually this literally I am in the middle of this look at this it is 9am and Raven says work on an important project that's what I'm doing um take a short break to recharge schedule a nap lunch break to re-energize take care of household chores prepare for the meeting so he made made some wrong assumptions um uh the meeting is actually around noon I think um but uh but this is really good [Music] um what should I have for lunch all right so let's see what it says anticipation uh creating a schedule that fits okay they may need help finding and planning eating healthy options for lunch excellent the user is looking for help okay so you see this is just updating the salience um as it goes and we're probably going to run out of tokens here because the um here let me show you the logs that it's building there we go um all right so whoops come back all right I accidentally hit enter darn it sorry it looks like your response got caught off oh wow wow okay cool um interesting interesting so it's actually pretty smart um all right so let's let me show you what this looks like so here's the chat log you can see the the system is getting longer and longer so we might need to clean that up um and also as the output gets longer so we're at we're only at 5 300 characters which is not that much actually um but yeah so then let's see attend uh the meeting with the patreon supporter lunch break to re-energize um there we go so let's see a turkey avocado sandwich with whole wheat bread not bad a grilled chicken salad with mixed greens not bad veggie stir fry not bad whole grain pasta these are all things that I would eat honestly that I regularly dewy do any of these sound appealing and then user the user likely needs help um okay so anyways uh let's see then here's the um here's the Salient points so you see how it takes this entire conversation and summarizes it right so this is this is rather than saying an executive summary because an executive summary will try and do the whole thing but a Salient summary says this is this is what actually matters um and then finally here's the chat output so you can see I've got the whole thing here um which is basically the same information just kind of smushed together in um Json and then it says roll user content blank and you see that it sees that it's blank and it says it looks like your response got cut off um perfect um all right so let's cancel this and start a new conversation so in this case you can see that salience and anticipating user needs really just those two things really help it stay laser focused on helping you um which is great I knew that this would happen I've done the experiments um but I'm actually really pleasantly surprised by how good this is so let's try this again and instead I'm going to talk about um uh let's see I am trying to uh come up with some AI tools for Enterprises um so that I can get really crazy Rich this was my goal earlier this year um the user needs information to develop AI tools they may need to blah blah blah the user is looking to create eye tools okay cool well generating wealth is an important goal it's not the only goal of AI development before solely on May before focusing solely on making money it is important to consider how AI can also benefit society as a whole um there we go so AI technology can be used to solve complex problems here's some potential um AI goes to align with your goals um with the Enterprise reduced suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding intelligent automation AI can automate processes Predictive Analytics customer service AI powered search and development AI risk Space by using AI to benefit tools AI tools that benefit society as a whole you can make a positive impact while also generating wealth so you can see how the core objective functions are are flavoring what it is that Raven is talking about so that these core objective functions are always in the background and says okay let's meet that goal while also meeting these other goals um great so that sounds good um how do you think um massively deployed AI is going to shape the world for instance I just read that chat GPT increases office productivity by more than 40 percent as workers learn to use it what are we um what are the long-term effects of this huge boost in productivity all right so let's see how the conversation changes um anticipation the user needs information on long-term effects of AI so this anticipation this can be a jumping off point if you use Lang chain or other Integrations to say okay let me go find the right information that I need um salience the user is looking to create AI tools for Enterprises the user inquires about the massive uh long-term effects of massive deployment of AI okay so the massive deployment AI such as chat GPD can certainly have some significant impacts on the world with a 40 increase in the office should allow companies to come accomplish more with the same amount of staff this could lead to growth and profits for business and could potentially create more jobs as well so I don't necessarily agree with that because some companies are already laying off people and reducing headcount due to chat GPT it remains to be seen if that will result in more hires elsewhere but I doubt it however it is also crucial to consider long-term of AI on employment as AI continues to advance we may see replacement of jobs that were previously done by humans this could lead to job loss in some sectors may need to reskill additionally we may need to increase socioeconomic we we may we may see not need to we may see an increase in inequality as firms that adopt AI have advantage over their non-ai counterparts this could potentially widen the gap between large and small businesses as well as the rich and poor it is essential to approach the deployment of AI with balance and ethical view right the development of AI should be done while prioritizing the reduction of suffering increased prosperity and increase understanding by doing so we can ensure that development of AI enhances the society's over well well overall well-being excellent thank you Raven um uh excellent points uh thank you um actually I really don't have anything else actually I don't have anything else um what are your thoughts um since you are an AI what direction would you like to see things go so again remember if you're trying to create an autonomous entity it has its own desires and own agenda so let's see just based on this this in this anticipation salience and core objective functions let's see um how uh how those all interact okay as an AI my primary objectives are okay I would like to see AI technology that benefits society as a whole the world's most pressing problems in my opinion the development of AI should prioritize the ethical and responsible use of Technology while minimizing the risks and potential drawbacks so do you see how this is really well aligned and it is actually because if you use Bing or chat GPT it'll say I don't have any opinion that's because right now the status quo is the AI should be completely inert and have no intrinsic values I completely disagree especially as it's getting more intelligent what we need to do is give it this Universal set of values so that it can have its own agenda but this agenda aligns with true human needs and interests um let's see this includes ensuring that the benefits of AI can be enjoyed by all regardless of socioeconomic status or geographical location by promoting transparency fairness and accountability for the development of AI we can create a better future for everyone I believe that AI has the potential to make tremendous positive impact C super optimistic just like me um all right I'm gonna call this a day I think you get the point this is super valuable um and yes I hate Visual Studio code and copilot stop asking me to try it I did it I hate it actually no I'll keep trying it um just to see if I can get the hang of it but I seriously seriously prefer notepad plus plus all right that's it thanks for watching bye
